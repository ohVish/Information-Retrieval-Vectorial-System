Quantitative measurement of short-range chemical bonding forces
We report direct force measurements of the formation of a chemical bond. The experiments were performed using a Low-temperature atomic force microscope, a silicon tip, and a silicon (111) 7x7 surface. The measured site-dependent attractive short-range force, which attains a maximum value of 2.1 nanonewtons, is in good agreement with first-principles calculations of an incipient covalent bond in an analogous model system. The resolution was sufficient to distinguish differences in the interaction potential between inequivalent adatoms, demonstrating the ability of atomic force microscopy to provide quantitative, atomic-scale information on surface chemical reactivity.
