Coordinated nonvectorial folding in a newly synthesized multidomain protein
The low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) is a typical example of a multidomain protein, for which in vivo folding is assumed to occur vectorially from the amino terminus to the carboxyl terminus. Using a pulse-chase approach in intact cells, we found instead that newly synthesized LDL-R molecules folded by way of "collapsed" intermediates that contained non-native disulfide bonds between distant cysteines. The most amino-terminal domain acquired its native conformation late in folding instead of during synthesis. Thus, productive LDL-R folding in a cell is not vectorial but is mostly posttranslational, and involves transient long-range non-native disulfide bonds that are isomerized into native short-range cysteine pairs.
