Formation of Al13I-: Evidence for the superhalogen character of Al-13
Al-13(-) is a cluster known for the pronounced stability that arises from coincident closures of its geometric and electronic shells. We present experimental evidence for a very stable cluster corresponding to Al13I-. Ab initio calculations show that the cluster features a structurally unperturbed Al-13(-) core and a region of high charge density on the aluminum vertex opposite from the iodine atom. This ionically bound magic cluster can be understood by considering that Al-13 has an electronic structure reminiscent of a halogen atom. Comparisons to polyhalides provide a sound explanation for our chemical observations.
