beta CaMKII in Lateral Habenula Mediates Core Symptoms of Depression
The lateral habenula (LHb) has recently emerged as a key brain region in the pathophysiology of depression. However, the molecular mechanism by which LHb becomes hyperactive in depression remains unknown. Through a quantitative proteomic screen, we found that expression of the beta form of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II (beta CaMKII) was significantly up-regulated in the LHb of animal models of depression and down-regulated by antidepressants. Increasing beta-, but not alpha-, CaMKII in the LHb strongly enhanced the synaptic efficacy and spike output of LHb neurons and was sufficient to produce profound depressive symptoms, including anhedonia and behavioral despair. Down-regulation of beta CaMKII levels, blocking its activity or its target molecule the glutamate receptor GluR1 reversed the depressive symptoms. These results identify beta CaMKII as a powerful regulator of LHb neuron function and a key molecular determinant of depression.
