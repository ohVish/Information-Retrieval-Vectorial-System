Ordered mesoporous materials from metal nanoparticle-block copolymer self-assembly
The synthesis of ordered mesoporous metal composites and ordered mesoporous metals is a challenge because metals have high surface energies that favor low surface areas. We present results from the self- assembly of block copolymers with ligand- stabilized platinum nanoparticles, leading to lamellar CCM- Pt- 4 and inverse hexagonal ( CCM- Pt- 6) hybrid mesostructures with high nanoparticle loadings. Pyrolysis of the CCM- Pt- 6 hybrid produces an ordered mesoporous platinum- carbon nanocomposite with open and large pores (>= 10 nanometers). Removal of the carbon leads to ordered porous platinum mesostructures. The platinum- carbon nanocomposite has very high electrical conductivity ( 400 siemens per centimeter) for an ordered mesoporous material fabricated from block copolymer self- assembly.
