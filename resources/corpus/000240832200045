Tunable quasi-two-dimensional electron gases in oxide heterostructures
We report on a large electric-field response of quasi-two-dimensional electron gases generated at interfaces in epitaxial heterostructures grown from insulating oxides. These device structures are characterized by doping layers that are spatially separated from high-mobility quasi-two-dimensional electron gases and therefore present an oxide analog to semiconducting high - electron mobility transistors. By applying a gate voltage, the conductivity of the electron gases can be modulated through a quantum phase transition from an insulating to a metallic state.
