Frictional afterslip following the 2005 Nias-Simeulue earthquake, Sumatra
Continuously recording Global Positioning System stations near the 28 March 2005 rupture of the Sunda megathrust [moment magnitude (M-w) 8.7] show that the earthquake triggered aseismic frictional afterstip on the subduction megathrust, with a major fraction of this slip in the up-dip direction from the main rupture. Eleven months after the main shock, afterstip continues at rates several times the average interseismic rate, resulting in deformation equivalent to at least a M-w 8.2 earthquake. In general, along-strike variations in frictional behavior appear to persist over multiple earthquake cycles. Aftershocks cluster along the boundary between the region of coseismic slip and the up-dip creeping zone. We observe that the cumulative number of aftershocks increases linearly with postseismic displacements; this finding suggests that the temporal evolution of aftershocks is governed by afterslip.
