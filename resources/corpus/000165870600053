External control of 20th century temperature by natural and anthropogenic forcings
A comparison of observations with simulations of a coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation model shows that both natural and anthropogenic factors have contributed significantly to 20th century temperature changes. The model successfully simulates global mean and Large-scale Land temperature variations, indicating that the climate response on these scales is strongly influenced by external factors. More than 80% of observed multidecadal-scale global mean temperature variations and more than 60% of 10- to 50-year Land temperature variations are due to changes in external forcings, Anthropogenic global warming under a standard emissions scenario is predicted to continue at a rate similar to that observed in recent decades.
