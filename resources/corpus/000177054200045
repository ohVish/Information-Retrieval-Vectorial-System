Sliding density wave in Sr14Cu24O41 ladder compounds
We used transport and Raman scattering measurements to identify the insulating state of self-doped spin 1/2 two-leg ladders of Sr14Cu24O41 as a weakly pinned, sliding density wave with nonlinear conductivity and a giant dielectric response that persists to remarkably high temperatures.
