Polymer gate dielectric surface viscoelasticity modulates pentacene transistor performance
Nanoscopically confined polymer films are known to exhibit substantially depressed glass transition temperatures (T-g's) as compared to the corresponding bulk materials. We report here that pentacene thin films grown on polymer gate dielectrics at temperatures well below their bulk T-g's exhibit distinctive and abrupt morphological and microstructural transitions and thin-film transistor (TFT) performance discontinuities at well-defined growth temperatures. The changes reflect the higher chain mobility of the dielectric in its rubbery state and are independent of dielectric film thickness. Optimization of organic TFT performance must recognize this fundamental buried interface viscoelasticity effect, which is detectable in the current-voltage response.
