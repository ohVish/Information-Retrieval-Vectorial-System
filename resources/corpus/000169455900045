Common and contrasting themes of plant and animal diseases
Recent studies in bacterial pathogenesis reveal common and contrasting mechanisms of pathogen virulence and host resistance in plant and animal diseases, This review presents recent developments in the study of plant and animal pathogenesis, with respect to bacterial colonization and the delivery of effector proteins to the host. Furthermore, host defense responses in both plants and animals are discussed in relation to mechanisms of pathogen recognition and defense signaling. Future studies will greatly add to our understanding of the molecular events defining host-pathogen interactions.
