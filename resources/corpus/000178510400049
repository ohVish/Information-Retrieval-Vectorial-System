Coordinate regulation of transcription and splicing by steroid receptor coregulators
Recent observations indicating that promoter identity influences alternative RNA-processing decisions have created interest in the regulatory interactions between RNA polymerase II transcription and precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) processing. We examined the impact of steroid receptor mediated transcription on RNA processing with reporter genes subject to alternative splicing driven by steroid- sensitive promoters. Steroid hormones affected the processing of pre-mRNA synthesized from steroid-sensitive promoters, but not from steroid-unresponsive promoters, in a steroid receptor dependent and receptor-selective manner. Several nuclear receptor coregulators showed differential splicing effects, suggesting that steroid hormone receptors may simultaneously control gene transcription activity and exon content of the product mRNA by recruiting coregulators involved in both processes.
