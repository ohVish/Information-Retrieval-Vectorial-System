Towards uranium catalysts
The forefront of research into the complexes of uranium reveals chemical transformations that challenge and expand our view of this unique element. Certain ligands form multiple bonds to uranium, and small, inert molecules such as nitrogen and carbon dioxide become reactive when in complex with the metal. Such complexes provide clues to the catalytic future of uranium, in which the applications of the element extend far beyond the nuclear industry. Most excitingly, the ability of uranium to use its outermost f electrons for binding ligands might enable the element to catalyse reactions that are impossible with conventional, transition- metal catalysts.
