Dopamine-mushroom body circuit regulates saliency-based decision-making in Drosophila
Drosophila melanogaster can make appropriate choices among alternative flight options on the basis of the relative salience of competing visual cues. We show that this choice behavior consists of early and late phases; the former requires activation of the dopaminergic system and mushroom bodies, whereas the latter is independent of these activities. Immunohistological analysis showed that mushroom bodies are densely innervated by dopaminergic axons. Thus, the circuit from the dopamine system to mushroom bodies is crucial for choice behavior in Drosophila.
