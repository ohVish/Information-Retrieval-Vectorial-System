Mitosis through the microscope: Advances in seeing inside live dividing cells
The most visually spectacular events in the life of a cell occur when it divides. This is especially true in higher eukaryotes, where the size and geometry of cells allow the division process to be followed through a microscope with considerable clarity. In these organisms, the membrane surrounding the nucleus breaks down after the replicated DNA has condensed to form discrete chromosomes. Several new structures are then assembled to separate the chromosomes and partition the cytoplasm into two separate cells.
