Microtubule motors in mitosis
The mitotic spindle uses microtubule-based motor proteins to assemble itself and to segregate sister chromatids. It is becoming clear that motors invoke several distinct mechanisms to generate the forces that drive mitosis. Moreover, in carrying out its function, the spindle appears to pass through a series of transient steady-state structures, each established by a delicate balance of forces generated by multiple complementary and antagonistic motors. Transitions from one steady state to the next can occur when a change in the activity of a subset of mitotic motors tips the balance.
