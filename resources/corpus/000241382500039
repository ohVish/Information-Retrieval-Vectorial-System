Dendritic cell stimulation by mycobacterial Hsp70 is mediated through CCR5
An effective host immune response to mycobacterial infection must control pathogen dissemination without inducing immunopathology. Constitutive overexpression of mycobacterial heat shock protein (myHsp70) is associated with impaired bacterial persistence, but the immune-mediated mechanisms are unknown. We found that myHsp70, in addition to enhancing antigen delivery to human dendritic cells, signaled through the CCR5 chemokine receptor, promoting dendritic cell aggregation, immune synapse formation between dendritic cells and T cells, and the generation of effector immune responses. Thus, CCR5 acts as a pattern-recognition receptor for myHsp70, which may have implications for both the pathophysiology of tuberculosis and the use of myHsps in tumor-directed immunotherapy.
