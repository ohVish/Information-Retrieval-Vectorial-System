High carrier mobility in single-crystal plasma-deposited diamond
Room-temperature drift mobilities of 4500 square centimeters per volt second for electrons and 3800 square centimeters per volt second for holes have been measured in high-purity single-crystal diamond grown using a chemical vapor deposition process. The low-field drift mobility values were determined by using the time-of-flight technique on thick, intrinsic, freestanding diamond plates and were verified by current-voltage measurements on p-i junction diodes. The improvement of the electronic properties of single-crystal diamond and the reproducibility of those properties are encouraging for research on, and development of, high-performance diamond electronics.
