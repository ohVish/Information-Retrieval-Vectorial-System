Climate change as the dominant control on glacial-interglacial variations in C-3 and C-4 plant abundance
Although C-4 plant expansions have been recognized in the late Miocene, identification of the underlying causes is complicated by the uncertainties associated with estimates of ancient precipitation, temperature, and partial pressure of atmospheric carbon dioxide (PCO2). Here we report the carbon isotopic compositions of leaf wax n-alkanes in take sediment cores from two sites in Mesoamerica that have experienced contrasting moisture variations since the last glacial maximum. Opposite isotopic trends obtained from these two sites indicate that regional climate exerts a strong control on the relative abundance of C-3 and C-4 plants and that in the absence of favorable moisture and temperature conditions, low PCO2 atone is insufficient to drive an expansion of C-4 plants.
