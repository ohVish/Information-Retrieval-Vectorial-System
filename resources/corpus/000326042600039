Strong Premelting Effect in the Elastic Properties of hcp-Fe Under Inner-Core Conditions
The observed shear-wave velocity V-S in Earth's core is much lower than expected from mineralogical models derived from both calculations and experiments. A number of explanations have been proposed, but none sufficiently explain the seismological observations. Using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, we obtained the elastic properties of hexagonal close-packed iron (hcp-Fe) at 360 gigapascals up to its melting temperature T-m. We found that Fe shows a strong nonlinear shear weakening just before melting (when T/T-m > 0.96), with a corresponding reduction in V-S. Because temperatures range from T/T-m = 1 at the inner-outer core boundary to T/T-m approximate to 0.99 at the center, this strong nonlinear effect on V-S should occur in the inner core, providing a compelling explanation for the low V-S observed.
