Enhanced optical emission during Crab giant radio pulses
We detected a correlation between optical and giant radio pulse emission from the Crab pulsar. Optical pulses coincident with the giant radio pulses were on average 3% brighter than those coincident with normal radio pulses. Combined with the lack of any other pulse pro. le changes, this result indicates that both the giant radio pulses and the increased optical emission are linked to an increase in the electron-positron plasma density.
