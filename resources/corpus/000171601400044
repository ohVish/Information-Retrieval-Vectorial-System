Carboxyl-terminal modulator protein (CTMP), a negative regulator of PKB/Akt and v-Akt at the plasma membrane
The PKB (protein kinase B, also called Akt) family of protein kinases plays a key role in insulin signaling, cellular survival, and transformation. PKB is activated by phosphorylation on residues threonine 308, by the protein kinase PDK1, and Serine 473, by a putative serine 473 kinase. Several protein binding partners for PKB have been identified. Here, we describe a protein partner for PKB alpha termed CTMP, or carboxyl-terminal modulator protein, that binds specifically to the carboxyl-terminal regulatory domain of PKB alpha at the plasma membrane. Binding of CTMP reduces the activity of PKB alpha by inhibiting phosphorylation on serine 473 and threonine 308. Moreover, CTMP expression reverts the phenotype of v-Akt-transformed cells examined under a number of criteria including cell morphology, growth rate, and in vivo tumorigenesis. These findings identify CTMP as a negative regulatory component of the pathway controlling PKB activity.
