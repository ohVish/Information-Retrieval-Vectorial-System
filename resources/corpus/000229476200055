Structure of oxidized alpha-haemoglobin bound to AHSP reveals a protective mechanism for haem
The synthesis of haemoglobin A (HbA) is exquisitely coordinated during erythrocyte development to prevent damaging effects from individual alpha- and beta-subunits(1,2). The alpha-haemoglobin-stabilizing protein (AHSP) binds alpha-haemoglobin (alpha Hb), inhibits the ability of alpha Hb to generate reactive oxygen species and prevents its precipitation on exposure to oxidant stress(3-5). The structure of AHSP bound to ferrous alpha Hb is thought to represent a transitional complex through which alpha Hb is converted to a non-reactive, hexacoordinate ferric form(5). Here we report the crystal structure of this ferric alpha Hb - AHSP complex at 2.4 angstrom resolution. Our findings reveal a striking bis-histidyl configuration in which both the proximal and the distal histidines coordinate the haem iron atom. To attain this unusual conformation, segments of alpha Hb undergo drastic structural rearrangements, including the repositioning of several alpha-helices. Moreover, conversion to the ferric bis-histidine configuration strongly and specifically inhibits redox chemistry catalysis and haem loss from alpha Hb. The observed structural changes, which impair the chemical reactivity of haem iron, explain how AHSP stabilizes alpha Hb and prevents its damaging effects in cells.
