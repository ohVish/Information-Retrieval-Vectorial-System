A 1,000-year sediment record of tsunami recurrence in northern Sumatra
The Indian Ocean tsunami of 26 December 2004 reached maximum wave heights of 35 m in Aceh, the northernmost province of Sumatra(1,2). Both the tsunami and the associated Sumatra Andaman earthquake were unprecedented in Acehnese history(3,4). Here we use sand sheets to extend tsunami history 1,000 years into Aceh's past. The 2004 tsunami deposited a sand sheet up to 1.8 km inland on a marshy beach ridge plain. Sediment cores from these coastal marshes revealed two older extensive sand sheets with similar sediment characteristics. These sheets, deposited soon after AD 1290 - 1400 and AD 780 - 990, probably resulted from earlier tsunamis. An additional sand sheet of limited extent might correlate with a documented smaller tsunami of AD 1907. These findings, a first step towards a palaeotsunami record for northern Sumatra, suggest that damage- causing tsunamis in Aceh recur infrequently enough for entire human lifetimes to typically elapse between them. Such recurrence adds to the challenge of preparing communities along the northern Indian Ocean shorelines for future tsunamis.
