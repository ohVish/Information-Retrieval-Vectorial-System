Photonics: Lasers producing tailored beams
Compact lasers that can produce a range of beam patterns are important for progress in several areas, including the improvement of optical tweezers, ultra-high-density optical memory and microfluidics. Here we engineer photonic crystals to generate semiconductor lasers that produce a range of beam patterns while maintaining stable single-mode oscillation. Our results could contribute to the realization of compact lasers that are capable of producing diverse beam patterns on demand.
