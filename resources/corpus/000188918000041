Chondrules with peculiar REE patterns: Implications for solar nebular condensation at high C/O
Rare earth element (REE) data from two ordinary chondrite chondrules show distinct negative chondrite-normalized concentration anomalies of samarium, europium, and ytterbium. The peculiar patterns may be the result of REE gas/solid fractionation at an oxygen fugacity lower than has been assumed for the canonical solar nebula. We suggest that the two ordinary chondrite chondrules acquired the fractionated REE patterns by incorporation of highly reduced, ultrarefractory condensates in their precursors. This interpretation implies that high-temperature condensation processes occurred in nebular environments with a strong deficit in oxygen, such as regions with an enhanced carbon/oxygen ratio.
