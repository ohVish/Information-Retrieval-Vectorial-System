Laboratory earthquakes: The sub-Rayleigh-to-supershear rupture transition
We report on the experimental observation of spontaneously nucleated supershear rupture and on the visualization of sub-Rayleigh-to-supershear rupture transitions in frictionally held interfaces. The laboratory experiments mimic natural earthquakes. The results suggest that under certain conditions supershear rupture propagation can be facilitated during large earthquake events.
