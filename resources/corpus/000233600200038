Atmospheric methane and nitrous oxide of the late Pleistocene from Antarctic ice cores
The European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica Dome C ice core enables us to extend existing records of atmospheric methane (CH(4)) and nitrous oxide (N(2)O) back to 650,000 years before the present. A combined record of CH(4) measured along the Dome C and the Vostok ice cores demonstrates, within the resolution of our measurements, that preindustrial concentrations over Antarctica have not exceeded 773 +/- 15 ppbv (parts per billion by volume) during the past 650,000 years. Before 420,000 years ago, when interglacials were cooler, maximum CH(4) concentrations were only about 600 ppbv, similar to lower Holocene values. In contrast, the N(2)O record shows maximum concentrations of 278 +/- 7 ppbv, slightly higher than early Holocene values.
