Formation of current coils in geodynamo simulations
Computer simulations have been playing an important role in the development of our understanding of the geodynamo(1-3), but direct numerical simulation of the geodynamo with a realistic parameter regime is still beyond the power of today's supercomputers. Difficulties in simulating the geodynamo arise from the extreme conditions of the core, which are characterized by very large or very small values of the non- dimensional parameters of the system. Among them, the Ekman number, E, has been adopted as a barometer of the distance of simulations from real core conditions, in which E is of the order of 10(-15). Following the initial computer simulations of the geodynamo(4,5), the Ekman number achieved has been steadily decreasing, with recent geodynamo simulations(6-8) performed with E of the order of 10(-6). Here we present a geodynamo simulation with an Ekman number of the order of 10(-7)-the highest-resolution simulation yet achieved, making use of 4,096 processors of the Earth Simulator. We have found that both the convection flow and magnetic field structures are qualitatively different from those found in larger- Ekman- number dynamos. The convection takes the form of sheet plumes or radial sheet jets(9), rather than the columnar cell structures(10) that are usually found. We have found that this sheet plume convection is an effective dynamo and the generated current is organized as a set of coils in the shape of helical springs or at times as a torus.
