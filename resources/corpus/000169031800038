Geometric manipulation of trapped ions for quantum computation
We propose an experimentally feasible scheme to achieve quantum computation based solely on geometric manipulations of a quantum system. The desired geometric operations are obtained by driving the quantum system to undergo appropriate adiabatic cyclic evolutions. Our implementation of the all-geometric quantum computation is based on Laser manipulation of a set of trapped ions. An all-geometric approach, apart from its fundamental interest, offers a possible method for robust quantum computation.
