Cranial skeletal biology
To artists, the face is a mirror of the soul. To biologists, the face reflects remarkable structural diversity think of bulldogs and wolfhounds or galapagos finches. How do such variations in skeletal form arise? Do the same mechanisms control skeletogenesis elsewhere in the body? The answers lie in the molecular machinery that generates neural crest cells, controls their migration, and guides their differentiation to cartilage and bone.
