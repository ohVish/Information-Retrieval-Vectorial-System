A uniform metal distribution in the intergalactic medium of the Perseus cluster of galaxies
Most of the metals (elements heavier than helium) produced by stars in the member galaxies of clusters currently reside within the hot, X-ray-emitting intra-cluster gas. Observations of X-ray line emission from this intergalactic medium have suggested a relatively small cluster-to-cluster scatter outside the cluster centres(1,2) and enrichment with iron out to large radii(3-5), leading to the idea that the metal enrichment occurred early in the history of the Universe(3). Models with early enrichment predict a uniform metal distribution at large radii in clusters, whereas those with late-time enrichment(6,7) are expected to introduce significant spatial variations of the metallicity. To discriminate clearly between these competing models, it is essential to test for potential inhomogeneities by measuring the abundances out to large radii along multiple directions in clusters, which has not hitherto been done. Here we report a remarkably uniform iron abundance, as a function of radius and azimuth, that is statistically consistent with a constant value of Z(Fe) = 0.306 +/- 0.012 in solar units out to the edge of the nearby Perseus cluster. This homogeneous distribution requires that most of the metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium occurred before the cluster formed, probably more than ten billion years ago, during the period of maximal star formation and black hole activity.
