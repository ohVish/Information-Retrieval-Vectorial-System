Technology challenges in responding to biological or chemical attacks in the civilian sector
Increasingly sophisticated technologies are needed for counterterrorism responses to biological and chemical warfare agents. Recently developed detection and identification systems are characterized by increased sensitivity, greater automation, and fewer false alarms. Attempts are also under way to reduce the cost and complexity of field-deployable systems. A broad range of decontamination reagents for equipment and personnel is emerging, but decontamination of large buildings, inaccessible spaces, and sensitive equipment remains problematic.
