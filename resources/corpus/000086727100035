Carrier-envelope phase control of femtosecond mode-locked lasers and direct optical frequency synthesis
We stabilized the carrier-envelope phase of the pulses emitted by a femtosecond mode-locked Laser by using the powerful tools of frequency-domain laser stabilization. We confirmed control of the pulse-to-pulse carrier-envelope phase using temporal cross correlation. This phase stabilization Locks the absolute frequencies emitted by the Laser, which we used to perform absolute optical frequency measurements that were directly referenced to a stable microwave clock.
