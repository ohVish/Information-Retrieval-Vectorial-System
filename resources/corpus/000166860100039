Interwoven metal-organic framework on a periodic minimal surface with extra-large pores
Interpenetration (catenation) has Long been considered a major impediment in the achievement of stable and porous crystalline structures. A strategy for the design of highly porous and structurally stable networks makes use of metalorganic building blocks that can be assembled on a triply periodic P-minimal geometric surface to produce structures that are interpenetrating-more accurately considered as interwoven. We used 4,4',4"-benzene-1,3,5-triyl-tribenzoic acid (H3BTB), copper(II) nitrate, and N,N'-dimethylformamide (DMF) to prepare Cu-3(BTB)(2)(H2O)(3). (DMF)(9)(H2O)(2) (MOF-14), whose structure reveals a pair of interwoven metal-organic frameworks that are mutually reinforced. The structure contains remarkably large pores, 16.4 angstroms in diameter, in which voluminous amounts of gases and organic solvents can be reversibly sorbed.
