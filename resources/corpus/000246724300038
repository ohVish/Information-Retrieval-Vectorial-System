Chondrite barium, neodymium, and samarium isotopic heterogeneity and early earth differentiation
Isotopic variability in barium, neodymium, and samarium in carbonaceous chondrites reflects the distinct stellar nucleosynthetic contributions to the early solar system. We used (148)Nd/(144)Nd to correct for the observed s-process deficiency, which produced a chondrite (146)Sm-(142)Nd isochron consistent with previous estimates of the initial solar system abundance of (146)Sm and a (142)Nd/(144)Nd at average chondrite Sm/Nd ratio that is lower than that measured in terrestrial rocks by 21 +/- 3 parts per million. This result strengthens the conclusion that the deficiency in (142)Nd in chondrites relative to terrestrial rocks reflects (146)Sm decay and early planetary differentiation processes.
