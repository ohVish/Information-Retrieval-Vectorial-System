Computational Approaches to Developmental Patterning
Computational approaches are breaking new ground in understanding how embryos form. Here, we discuss recent studies that couple precise measurements in the embryo with appropriately matched modeling and computational methods to investigate classic embryonic patterning strategies. We include signaling gradients, activator-inhibitor systems, and coupled oscillators, as well as emerging paradigms such as tissue deformation. Parallel progress in theory and experiment will play an increasingly central role in deciphering developmental patterning.
