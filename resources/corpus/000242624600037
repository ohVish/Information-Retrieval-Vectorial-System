Operation of a DNA robot arm inserted into a 2D DNA crystalline substrate
The success of nanorobotics requires the precise placement and subsequent operation of specific nanomechanical devices at particular locations. The structural programmability of DNA makes it a particularly attractive system for nanorobotics. We have developed a cassette that enables the placement of a robust, sequence-dependent DNA robot arm within a two-dimensional (2D) crystalline DNA array. The cassette contains the device, an attachment site, and a reporter of state. We used atomic force microscopy to demonstrate that the rotary device is fully functional after insertion. Thus, a nanomechanical device can operate within a fixed frame of reference.
