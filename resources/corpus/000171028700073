Requirement of tissue-selective TBP-associated factor TAF(II)105 in ovarian development
Transcription factor TFIID, composed of TBP and TAF(11) subunits, is a central component of the RNA polymerase II machinery. Here, we report that the tissue-selective TAF(11)105 subunit of TFIID is essential for proper development and function of the mouse ovary. Female mice lacking TAF(11)105 are viable but infertile because of a defect in folliculogenesis correlating with restricted expression of TAF(11)105 in the granulosa cells of the ovarian follicle. Gene expression profiling has uncovered a defective inhibin-activin signaling pathway in TAF(11)105-deficient ovaries. Together, these studies suggest that TAF(11)105 mediates the transcription of a subset of genes required for proper folliculogenesis in the ovary and establishes TAF(11)105 as a cell type-specific component of the mammalian transcriptional machinery.
