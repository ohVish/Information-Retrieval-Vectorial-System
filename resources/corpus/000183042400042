Thin-film transistor fabricated in single-crystalline transparent oxide semiconductor
We report the fabrication of transparent field-effect transistors using a single-crystalline thin-film transparent oxide semiconductor, InGaO3(ZnO)(5), as an electron channel and amorphous hafnium oxide as a gate insulator. The device exhibits an on-to-off current ratio of similar to10(6) and a field-effect mobility of similar to80 square centimeters per volt per second at room temperature, with operation insensitive to visible light irradiation. The result provides a step toward the realization of transparent electronics for next-generation optoelectronics.
