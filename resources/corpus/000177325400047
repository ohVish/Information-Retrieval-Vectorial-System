Est1p as a cell cycle-regulated activator of telomere-bound telomerase
In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the telomerase components Est2p, TLC1 RNA, Est1p, and Est3p are thought to form a complex that acts late during chromosome replication ( S phase) upon recruitment by Cdc13p, a telomeric DNA binding protein. Consistent with this model, we show that Est1p, Est2p, and Cdc13p are telomere-associated at this time. However, Est2p, but not Est1p, also binds telomeres before late S phase. The cdc13-2 allele has been proposed to be defective in recruitment, yet Est1p and Est2p telomere association persists in cdc13-2 cells. These findings suggest a model in which Est1p binds telomeres late in S phase and interacts with Cdc13p to convert inactive, telomere-bound Est2p to an active form.
