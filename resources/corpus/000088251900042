Non-collinear states in magnetic sensors
Certain materials have an electrical conductivity that is extremely sensitive to an applied magnetic field; this phenomenon, termed 'giant magnetoresistance'(1-3), can be used in sensor applications. Typically, such a device comprises several ferromagnetic layers, separated by non-magnetic spacer layer(s)-a so-called 'super-lattice' geometry(1-3). In the absence of a magnetic field, the ferromagnetic layers may be magnetized in opposite directions by interlayer exchange coupling, while an applied external magnetic field causes the magnetization directions to become parallel. Because the resistivity depends on the magnetization direction, an applied field that changes the magnetic configuration may be detected simply by measuring the change in resistance. In order to detect weak fields, the energy difference between different magnetization directions should be small; this is usually achieved by using many non-magnetic atomic spacer layers. Here we show, using first-principles theory, that materials combinations such as Fe/V/Co multilayers can produce a non-collinear magnetic state in which the magnetization direction between Fe and Co layers differs by about 90 degrees. This state is energetically almost degenerate with the collinear magnetic states, even though the number of non-magnetic vanadium spacer layers is quite small.
