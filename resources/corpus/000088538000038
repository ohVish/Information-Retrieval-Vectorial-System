Pixel switching of epitaxial Pd/YHx/CaF2 switchable mirrors
Exposure of rare-earth films to hydrogen can induce a metal-insulator transition, accompanied by pronounced optical changes. This 'switchable mirror' effect(1) has received considerable attention from theoretical(2-4), experimental(5) and technological(6) points of view. Most systems use polycrystalline films, but the synthesis of yttrium-based epitaxial switchable mirrors(7) has also been reported. The latter form an extended self-organized ridge network during initial hydrogen loading(7), which results in the creation of micrometre-sized triangular domains. Here we observe homogeneous and essentially independent optical switching of individual domains in epitaxial switchable mirrors during hydrogen absorption. The optical switching is accompanied by topographical changes as the domains sequentially expand and contract; the ridges block lateral hydrogen diffusion and serve as a microscopic lubricant for the domain oscillations. We observe the correlated changes in topology and optical properties using in situ atomic force and optical microscopy. Single-domain phase switching is not observed in polycrystalline films, which are optically homogeneous(8). The ability to generate a tunable, dense pattern of switchable pixels is of technological relevance for solid-state displays based on switchable mirrors.
