Cyclic AMP-induced repair of zebrafish spinal circuits
Neurons in the human central nervous system (CNS) are unable to regenerate, as a result of both an inhibitory environment and their inherent inability to regrow. In contrast, the CNS environment in fish is permissive for growth, yet some neurons still cannot regenerate. Fish thus offer an opportunity to study molecules that might surmount the intrinsic limitations they share with mammals, without the complication of an inhibitory environment. We show by in vivo imaging in zebra fish that post-injury application of cyclic adenosine monophosphate can transform severed CNS neurons into ones that regenerate and restore function, thus overcoming intrinsic limitations to regeneration in a vertebrate.
