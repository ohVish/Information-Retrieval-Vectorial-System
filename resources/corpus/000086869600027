Chemistry - Whither the future of controlling quantum phenomena?
This review puts into perspective the present state and prospects for controlling phenomena in atoms and molecules. The topics considered include the nature of physical and chemical control objectives, the development of possible ii quantum control rules of thumb, the theoretical design of controls and their Laboratory tory realization, quantum learning and feedback control in the laboratory, bulk media influences, and the ability to utilize coherent quantum manipulation as a means for extracting microscopic information. The preview of the field presented here suggests that important advances in the control of molecules and the capability of Learning about molecular interactions may be reached through the application of emerging theoretical concepts and laboratory technologies.
