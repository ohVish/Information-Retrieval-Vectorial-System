Loss of Function of a Proline-Containing Protein Confers Durable Disease Resistance in Rice
Blast disease is a devastating fungal disease of rice, one of the world's staple foods. Race-specific resistance to blast disease has usually not been durable. Here, we report the cloning of a previously unknown type of gene that confers non-race-specific resistance and its successful use in breeding. Pi21 encodes a proline-rich protein that includes a putative heavy metal-binding domain and putative protein-protein interaction motifs. Wild-type Pi21 appears to slow the plant's defense responses, which may support optimization of defense mechanisms. Deletions in its proline-rich motif inhibit this slowing. Pi21 is separable from a closely linked gene conferring poor flavor. The resistant pi21 allele, which is found in some strains of japonica rice, could improve blast resistance of rice worldwide.
