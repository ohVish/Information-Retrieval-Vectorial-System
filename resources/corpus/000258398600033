Inner-core shear-wave anisotropy and texture from an observation of PKJKP waves
Since the discovery of the Earth's core a century ago(1), and the subsequent discovery(2) of a solid inner core (postulated to have formed by the freezing of iron(3)) seismologists have striven to understand this most remote part of the deep Earth. The most direct evidence for a solid inner core would be the observation of shear-mode body waves that traverse it, but these phases are extremely difficult to observe. Two reported observations in short-period data(4,5) have proved controversial(6). Arguably more successful have been studies of longer-period data(6,7), but such averaging limits the usefulness of the observations to reported sightings. We present two observations of an inner-core shear-wave phase at higher frequencies in stacked data from the Japanese High-Sensitivity Array, Hi-Net(8). From an analysis of timing, amplitude and waveform of the 'PKJKP' phase we derive constraints on inner-core compressional-wave velocity and shear attenuation at about 0.3 Hz which differ from standard isotropic core models(9). We can explain waveform features and can partially reconcile the otherwise large differences between core wavespeed and attenuation models that our observations apparently suggest if we invoke shear-wave anisotropy in the inner core. A simple model of an inner core composed of hexagonal close-packed iron with its c axis aligned perpendicular to the rotation axis(10) yields anisotropy that is compatible with both the shear-wave anisotropy that we observe and the well-established 3 per cent compressional-wave anisotropy.
