Neodymium-142 evidence for hadean mafic crust
Neodymium-142 data for rocks from the Nuvvuagittuq greenstone belt in northern Quebec, Canada, show that some rock types have lower (142)Nd/(144)Nd ratios than the terrestrial standard (epsilon(142)Nd = - 0.07 to - 0.15). Within a mafic amphibolite unit, 142Nd/144Nd ratios correlate positively with Sm/Nd ratios and produce a (146)Sm-(142)Nd isochron with an age of 4280(-81)(vertical bar) (53) million years. These rocks thus sample incompatible- element- enriched material formed shortly after Earth formation and may represent the oldest preserved crustal section on Earth.
