Electronically induced atom motion engineered CoCun nanostructures
We have measured the quantum yield for exciting the motion of a single Co atom in CoCun linear molecules constructed on a Cu(111) surface. The Co atom switched between two lattice positions during electron excitation from the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope. The tip location with highest probability for inducing motion was consistent with the position of an active state identified through electronic structure calculations. Atom motion within the molecule decreased with increased molecular length and reflected the corresponding variation in electronic structure.
