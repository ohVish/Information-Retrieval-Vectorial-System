Demography of dietary restriction and death in Drosophila
Dietary restriction (DR) increases life-span in organisms from yeast to mammals, presumably by slowing the accumulation of aging-related damage. Here we show that in Drosophila, DR extends life-span entirely by reducing the short-term risk of death. Two days after the application of DR at any age for the first time, previously fully fed flies are no more likely to die than flies of the same age that have been subjected to long-term DR. DR of mammals may also reduce short-term risk of death, and hence DR instigated at any age could generate a full reversal of mortality.
