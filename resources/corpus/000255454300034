Structure and dynamics of Earth's lower mantle
Processes within the lowest several hundred kilometers of Earth's rocky mantle play a critical role in the evolution of the planet. Understanding Earth's lower mantle requires putting recent seismic and mineral physics discoveries into a self- consistent, geodynamically feasible context. Two nearly antipodal large low- shear- velocity provinces in the deep mantle likely represent chemically distinct and denser material. High- resolution seismological studies have revealed laterally varying seismic velocity discontinuities in the deepest few hundred kilometers, consistent with a phase transition from perovskite to post- perovskite. In the deepest tens of kilometers of the mantle, isolated pockets of ultralow seismic velocities may denote Earth's deepest magma chamber.
