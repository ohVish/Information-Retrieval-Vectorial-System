Planetary science - X-ray emission from comets
The discovery of x-ray emission from comet Hyakutake was surprising given that comets are known to be cold. observations by x-ray satellites such as the Rontgen Satellite (ROSAT) indicate that x-rays are produced by almost all comets. Theoretical and observational work has demonstrated that charge-exchange collisions of highly charged solar wind ions with cometary neutral species can explain this emission. X-ray observations of comets and other solar system objects may be used to determine the structure and dynamics of the solar wind.
