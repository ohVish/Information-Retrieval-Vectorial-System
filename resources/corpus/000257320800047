Characterization of step-edge barriers in organic thin-film growth
Detailed understanding of growth mechanisms in organic thin- film deposition is crucial for tailoring growth morphologies, which in turn determine the physical properties of the resulting films. For growth of the rodlike molecule para- sexiphenyl, the evolution of terraced mounds is observed by atomic force microscopy. Using methods established in inorganic epitaxy, we demonstrate the existence of an additional barrier ( 0.67 electron volt) for step- edge crossing- the Ehrlich- Schwoebel barrier. This result was confirmed by transition state theory, which revealed a bending of the molecule at the step edge. A gradual reduction of this barrier in the first layers led to an almost layer- by- layer growth during early deposition stage. The reported phenomena are a direct consequence of the complexity of the molecular building blocks versus atomic systems.
