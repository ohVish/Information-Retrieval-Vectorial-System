Magnetic moment and plasma environment of HD 209458b as determined from Ly alpha observations
Transit observations of HD 209458b in the stellar Lyman-alpha(Ly alpha) line revealed strong absorption in both blue and red wings of the line interpreted as hydrogen atoms escaping from the planet's exosphere at high velocities. The following sources for the absorption were suggested: acceleration by the stellar radiation pressure, natural spectral line broadening, or charge exchange with the stellar wind. We reproduced the observation by means of modeling that includes all aforementioned processes. Our results support a stellar wind with a velocity of approximate to 400 kilometers per second at the time of the observation and a planetary magnetic moment of approximate to 1.6 x 10(26) amperes per square meter.
