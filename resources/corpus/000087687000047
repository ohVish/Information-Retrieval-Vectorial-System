Discovery of a basaltic asteroid in the outer main belt
Visible and near-infrared spectroscopic observations of the asteroid 1459 Magnya indicate that it:has a basaltic surface. Magnya is at 3.15 astronomical units (AU) from the sun and has no known dynamical link to any family, to any nearby Large asteroid, or to asteroid 4 Vesta at 2.36 AU, which is the only other known large basaltic asteroid. We show that the region of the belt around Magnya is densely filled by mean-motion resonances, generating slow orbital diffusion processes and providing a potential mechanism for removing other basaltic fragments that may have been created on the same:parent body as Magnya. Magnya may represent a rare surviving fragment from a Larger, differentiated planetesimal that was disrupted long ago.
