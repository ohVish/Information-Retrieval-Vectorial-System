A gamma-ray burst with a high-energy spectral component inconsistent with the synchrotron shock model
Gamma-ray bursts are among the most powerful events in nature. These events release most of their energy as photons with energies in the range from 30 keV to a few MeV, with a smaller fraction of the energy radiated in radio, optical, and soft X-ray afterglows(1). The data are in general agreement with a relativistic shock model(2), where the prompt and afterglow emissions 3 correspond to synchrotron radiation from shock-accelerated electrons. Here we report an observation of a high-energy (multi-MeV) spectral component in the burst of 17 October 1994 that is distinct from the previously observed lower-energy gamma-ray component. The flux of the high-energy component decays more slowly and its fluence is greater than the lower-energy component; it is described by a power law of differential photon number index approximately 21 up to about 200 MeV. This observation is difficult to explain with the standard synchrotron shock model(2), suggesting the presence of new phenomena such as a different non-thermal electron process, or the interaction of relativistic protons with photons at the source.
