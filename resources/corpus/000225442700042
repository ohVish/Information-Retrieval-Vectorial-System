Common and distinct elements in cellular signaling via EGF and FGF receptors
Signaling pathways that are activated by epidermal growth factor (EGF) or fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors have been identified and compared (detailed Connections Maps are available at Science's Signal Transduction Knowledge Environment). Both receptors stimulate a similar complement of intracellular signaling pathways. However, whereas activated EGF receptors (EGFRs) function as the main platform for recruitment of signaling proteins, signaling through the FGF receptors (FGFRs) is mediated primarily by assembly of a multidocking protein complex. Moreover, FGFR signaling is subject to additional intracellular and extracellular control mechanisms that do not affect EGFR signaling. The differential circuitry of the intracellular networks that are activated by EGFR and FGFR may affect signal specificity and physiological responses.
