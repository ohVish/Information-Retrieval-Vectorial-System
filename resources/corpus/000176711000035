Maps of subsurface hydrogen from the high energy neutron detector, Mars Odyssey
After 55 days of mapping by the High Energy Neutron Detector onboard Mars Odyssey, we found deficits of high-energy neutrons in the southern highlands and northern lowlands of Mars. These deficits indicate that hydrogen is concentrated in the subsurface. Modeling suggests that water ice rich layers that are tens of centimeters in thickness provide one possible fit to the data.
