Clonal analysis reveals a common progenitor for thymic cortical and medullary epithelium
The thymus provides an essential environment for the development of T cells from haemopoietic progenitors. This environment is separated into cortical and medullary regions, each containing functionally distinct epithelial populations that are important at successive stages of T-cell development and selection(1,2). However, the developmental origin and lineage relationships between cortical and medullary epithelial cell types remain controversial(3). Here we describe a clonal assay to investigate the developmental potential of single, individually selected, thymic epithelial progenitors ( marked with enhanced yellow fluorescent protein) developing within the normal architecture of the thymus. Using this approach, we show that cortical and medullary epithelial cells share a common origin in bipotent precursors, providing definitive evidence that they have a single rather than dual germ layer origin during embryogenesis. Our findings resolve a long-standing issue in thymus development, and are important in relation to the development of cell-based strategies for thymus disorders and the possibility of restoring function of the atrophied adult thymus.
