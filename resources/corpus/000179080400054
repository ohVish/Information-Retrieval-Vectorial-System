The neurotrophin receptor p75(NTR) as a positive modulator of myelination
Schwann cells in developing and regenerating peripheral nerves express elevated levels of the neurotrophin receptor p75(NTR). Neurotrophins are key mediators of peripheral nervous system myelination. Our results show that myelin formation is inhibited in the absence of functional p75(NTR) and enhanced by blocking TrkC activity. Moreover, the enhancement of myelin formation by endogenous brain-derived neurotrophic factor is mediated by the p75(NTR) receptor, whereas TrkC receptors are responsible for neurotrophin-3 inhibition. Thus p75(NTR) and TrkC receptors have opposite effects on myelination.
