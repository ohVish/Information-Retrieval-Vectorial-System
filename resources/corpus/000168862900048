Promotion of NEDD8-CUL1 conjugate cleavage by COP9 signalosome
SCF ubiquitin ligases control various processes by marking regulatory proteins for ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. To illuminate how SCF complexes are regulated, we sought proteins that interact with the human SCF component CUL1. The COP9 signalosome (CSN), a suppressor of plant photomorphogenesis, associated with multiple cullins and promoted cleavage of the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 from Schizosaccharomyces pombe CUL1 in vivo and in vitro. Multiple NEDD8-modified proteins uniquely accumulated in CSN-deficient S. pombe cells. We propose that the broad spectrum of activities previously attributed to CSN subunits-including repression of photomorphogenesis, activation of JUN, and activation of p27 nuclear export-underscores the importance of dynamic cycles of NEDD8 attachment and removal in biological regulation.
