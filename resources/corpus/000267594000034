Detection of Perchlorate and the Soluble Chemistry of Martian Soil at the Phoenix Lander Site
The Wet Chemistry Laboratory on the Phoenix Mars Lander performed aqueous chemical analyses of martian soil from the polygon-patterned northern plains of the Vastitas Borealis. The solutions contained similar to 10 mM of dissolved salts with 0.4 to 0.6% perchlorate (ClO(4)) by mass leached from each sample. The remaining anions included small concentrations of chloride, bicarbonate, and possibly sulfate. Cations were dominated by Mg(2+) and Na(+), with small contributions from K(+) and Ca(2+). A moderately alkaline pH of 7.7 +/- 0.5 was measured, consistent with a carbonate-buffered solution. Samples analyzed from the surface and the excavated boundary of the similar to 5-centimeter-deep ice table showed no significant difference in soluble chemistry.
