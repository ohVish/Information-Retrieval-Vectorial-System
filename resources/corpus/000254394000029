Doped nanocrystals
The critical role that dopants play in semiconductor devices has stimulated research on the properties and the potential applications of semiconductor nanocrystals, or colloidal quantum dots, doped with intentional impurities. We review advances in the chemical synthesis of doped nanocrystals, in the theoretical understanding of the fundamental mechanisms that control doping, and in the creation of highly conducting nanocrystalline films. Because impurities can be used to alter the properties of nanoscale materials in desirable and controllable ways, doped nanocrystals can address key problems in applications from solar cells to bioimaging.
