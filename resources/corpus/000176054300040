Microfluidic control using colloidal devices
By manipulating colloidal microspheres within customized channels, we have created micrometer-scale fluid pumps and particulate valves. We describe two positive-displacement designs, a gear and a peristaltic pump, both of which are about the size of a human red blood cell. Two colloidal valve designs,are also demonstrated, one actuated and one passive, for the direction of cells or small particles. The use of colloids as both valves and pumps wit[ allow device integration at a density far beyond what is currently achievable by other approaches and may provide a link between fluid manipulation at the macro- and nanoscale.
