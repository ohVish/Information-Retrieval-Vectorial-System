Large disparity between gallium and antimony self-diffusion in gallium antimonide
The most fundamental mass transport process in solids is selfdiffusion. The motion of host-lattice (`self-') atoms in solids is mediated by point defects such as vacancies or interstitial atoms, whose formation and migration enthalpies determine the kinetics of this thermally activated process(1,2). Self-diffusion studies also contribute to the understanding of the diffusion of impurities, and a quantitative understanding of self- and foreign-atom diffusion in semiconductors is central to the development of advanced electronic devices. In the past few years, self- diffusion studies have been performed successfully with isotopically controlled semiconductor heterostructures of germanium(3), silicon(4), gallium arsenide(5,6) and gallium phosphide(7). Self- diffusion studies with isotopically controlled GaAs and GaP have been restricted to Ga self- diffusion, as only Ga has two stable isotopes, Ga-69 and Ga-71. Here we report self- diffusion studies with an isotopically controlled multilayer structure of crystalline GaSb. Two stable isotopes exist for both Ga and Sb, allowing the simultaneous study of diffusion on both sublattices. Our experiments show that near the melting temperature, Ga diffuses more rapidly than Sb by over three orders of magnitude. This surprisingly large difference in atomic mobility requires a physical explanation going beyond standard diffusion models. Combining our data for Ga and Sb diffusion with related results for foreign-atom diffusion in GaSb (refs 8, 9), we conclude that the unusually slow Sb diffusion in GaSb is a consequence of reactions between defects on the Ga and Sb sublattices, which suppress the defects that are required for Sb diffusion.
