Lewis Acidity of Organofluorophosphonium Salts: Hydrodefluorination by a Saturated Acceptor
Prototypical Lewis acids, such as boranes, derive their reactivity from electronic unsaturation. Here, we report the Lewis acidity and catalytic application of electronically saturated phosphorus-centered electrophilic acceptors. Organofluorophosphonium salts of the formula [(C6F5)(3-x)PhxPF][B(C6F5)(4)] (x = 0 or 1; Ph, phenyl) are shown to form adducts with neutral Lewis bases and to react rapidly with fluoroalkanes to produce difluorophosphoranes. In the presence of hydrosilane, the cation [(C6F5)(3)PF](+) is shown to catalyze the hydrodefluorination of fluoroalkanes, affording alkanes and fluorosilane. The mechanism demonstrates the impressive fluoride ion affinity of this highly electron-deficient phosphonium center.
