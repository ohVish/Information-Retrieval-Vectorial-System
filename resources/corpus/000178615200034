Cavity solitons as pixels in semiconductor microcavities
Cavity solitons are localized intensity peaks that can form in a homogeneous background of radiation. They are generated by shining laser pulses into optical cavities that contain a nonlinear medium driven by a coherent field (holding beam). The ability to switch cavity solitons on and off(1,2) and to control their location and motion(3) by applying laser pulses makes them interesting as potential 'pixels' for reconfigurable arrays or all-optical processing units. Theoretical work on cavity solitons(2-7) has stimulated a variety of experiments in macroscopic cavities(8-10) and in systems with optical feedback(11-13). But for practical devices, it is desirable to generate cavity solitons in semiconductor structures, which would allow fast response and miniaturization. The existence of cavity solitons in semiconductor microcavities has been predicted theoretically(14-17), and precursors of cavity solitons have been observed, but clear experimental realization has been hindered by boundary-dependence of the resulting optical patterns (18,19)-cavity solitons should be self-confined. Here we demonstrate the generation of cavity solitons in vertical cavity semiconductor microresonators that are electrically pumped above transparency but slightly below lasing threshold(20).We show that the generated optical spots can be written, erased and manipulated as objects independent of each other and of the boundary. Numerical simulations allow for a clearer interpretation of experimental results.
