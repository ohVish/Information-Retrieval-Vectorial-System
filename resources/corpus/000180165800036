Neuronal activity in the lateral intraparietal area and spatial attention
Although the parietal cortex has been implicated in the neural processes underlying visual attention, the nature of its contribution is not well understood. We tracked attention in the monkey and correlated the activity of neurons in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) with the monkey's attentional performance. The ensemble activity in LIP across the entire visual field describes the spatial and temporal dynamics of a monkey's attention. Activity subtending a single location in the visual. field describes the attentional priority at that area but does not predict that the monkey will actually attend to or make an eye movement to that location.
