The Structure of Human 5-Lipoxygenase
The synthesis of both proinflammatory leukotrienes and anti-inflammatory lipoxins requires the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX). 5-LOX activity is short-lived, apparently in part because of an intrinsic instability of the enzyme. We identified a 5-LOX-specific destabilizing sequence that is involved in orienting the carboxyl terminus, which binds the catalytic iron. Here, we report the crystal structure at 2.4 angstrom resolution of human 5-LOX stabilized by replacement of this sequence.
