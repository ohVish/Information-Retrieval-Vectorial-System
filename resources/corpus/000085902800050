Genomic medicine and the future of health care
Genomic technologies and computational advances are Leading to an information revolution in biology and medicine. Simulations of molecular processes in cells and predictions of drug effects in humans will advance pharmaceutical research and speed up clinical trials. Computational prognostics and diagnostics that combine clinical data with genotyping and molecular profiling may soon cause fundamental changes in the practice of health care.
