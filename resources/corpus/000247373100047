Cretaceous eutherians and Laurasian origin for placental mammals near the K/T boundary
Estimates of the time of origin for placental mammals from DNA studies span nearly the duration of the Cretaceous period ( 145 to 65 million years ago), with a maximum of 129 million years ago(1) and a minimum of 78 million years ago(2). Palaeontologists too are divided on the timing. Some(3-5) support a deep Cretaceous origin by allying certain middle Cretaceous fossils ( 97 90 million years old) from Uzbekistan with modern placental lineages, whereas others(6,7) support the origin of crown group Placentalia near the close of the Cretaceous. This controversy has yet to be addressed by a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis that includes all well-known Cretaceous fossils and a wide sample of morphology among Tertiary and recent placentals(6). Here we report the discovery of a new well-preserved mammal from the Late Cretaceous of Mongolia and a broad-scale phylogenetic analysis. Our results exclude Cretaceous fossils from Placentalia, place the origin of Placentalia near the Cretaceous/Tertiary (K/T) boundary in Laurasia rather than much earlier within the Cretaceous in the Southern Hemisphere(8,9), and place afrotherians and xenarthrans in a nested rather than a basal position(8,9) within Placentalia.
