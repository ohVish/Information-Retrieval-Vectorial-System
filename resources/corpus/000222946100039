Crystal structure of the calcium pump with a bound ATP analogue
P-type ATPases are ATP-powered ion pumps that establish ion concentration gradients across cell and organelle membranes. Here, we describe the crystal structure of the Ca2+ pump of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum, a representative member of the P-type ATPase superfamily, with an ATPanalogue, a Mg2+ and two Ca2+ ions in the respective binding sites. In this state, the ATP analogue reorganizes the three cytoplasmic domains ( A, N and P), which are widely separated without nucleotide, by directly bridging the N and P domains. The structure of the P-domain itself is altered by the binding of the ATP analogue and Mg2+. As a result, the A-domain is tilted so that one of the transmembrane helices moves to lock the cytoplasmic gate of the transmembrane Ca2+-binding sites. This appears to be the mechanism for occluding the bound Ca2+ ions, before releasing them into the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum.
