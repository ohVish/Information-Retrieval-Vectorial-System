Sustainable Fe-ppm Pd nanoparticle catalysis of Suzuki-Miyaura cross-couplings in water
Most of today's use of transition metal-catalyzed cross-coupling chemistry relies on expensive quantities of palladium (Pd). Here we report that nanoparticles formed from inexpensive FeCl3 that naturally contains parts-per-million (ppm) levels of Pd can catalyze Suzuki-Miyaura reactions, including cases that involve highly challenging reaction partners. Nanomicelles are employed to both solubilize and deliver the reaction partners to the Fe-ppm Pd catalyst, resulting in carbon-carbon bond formation. The newly formed catalyst can be isolated and stored at ambient temperatures. Aqueous reaction mixtures containing both the surfactant and the catalyst can be recycled.
