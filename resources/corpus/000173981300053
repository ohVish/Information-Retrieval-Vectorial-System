Role of nucleoporin induction in releasing an mRNA nuclear export block
Signal-mediated nuclear import and export proceed through the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Some NPC components, such as the nucleoporins (Nups) Nup98 and Nup96, are also associated with the nuclear interior. Nup98 is a target of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) matrix (M) protein-mediated inhibition of messenger RNA (mRNA) nuclear export. Here, Nup98 and Nup96 were found to be up-regulated by interferon (IFN). M protein-mediated inhibition of mRNA nuclear export was reversed when cells were treated with IFN-gamma or transfected with a complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding Nup98 and Nup96. Thus, increased Nup98 and Nup96 expression constitutes an IFN-mediated mechanism that reverses M protein-mediated inhibition of gene expression.
