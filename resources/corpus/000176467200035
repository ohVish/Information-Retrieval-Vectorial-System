Nitrate controls on iron and arsenic in an urban lake
Aquatic ecosystems are often contaminated by multiple substances. Nitrate, a common aquatic pollutant, strongly influenced the cycling of arsenic (As) under anoxic conditions in urban Upper Mystic Lake (Massachusetts, USA) by oxidizing ferrous iron [Fe(II)] to produce As-sorbing particulate hydrous ferric oxides and causing the more oxidized As(V), which is more particle-reactive than As(III) under these conditions, to dominate. This process is likely to be important in many natural waters.
