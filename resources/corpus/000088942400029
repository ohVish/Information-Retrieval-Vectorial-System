Hydrological impact of Heinrich events in the subtropical northeast Atlantic
Reconstructing the impact of Heinrich events outside the main belt of ice rafting is crucial to understanding the underlying causes of these abrupt climatic events. A high-resolution study of a marine sediment core from the Iberian margin demonstrates that this midlatitude area was strongly affected both by cooling and advection of low-salinity arctic water masses during the Last three Heinrich events. These paleoclimatic time series reveal the internal complexity of each of the last three Heinrich events and illustrate the value of parallel studies of the organic and inorganic fractions of the sediments.
