Strange Metal Transport Realized by Gauge/Gravity Duality
Fermi liquid theory explains the thermodynamic and transport properties of most metals. The so-called non-Fermi liquids deviate from these expectations and include exotic systems such as the strange metal phase of cuprate superconductors and heavy fermion materials near a quantum phase transition. We used the anti-de-Sitter/conformal field theory correspondence to identify a class of non-Fermi liquids; their low-energy behavior is found to be governed by a nontrivial infrared fixed point, which exhibits nonanalytic scaling behavior only in the time direction. For some representatives of this class, the resistivity has a linear temperature dependence, as is the case for strange metals.
