Inconsistency in large pharmacogenomic studies
Two large-scale pharmacogenomic studies were published recently in this journal. Genomic data are well correlated between studies; however, the measured drug response data are highly discordant. Although the source of inconsistencies remains uncertain, it has potential implications for using these outcome measures to assess gene-drug associations or select potential anticancer drugs on the basis of their reported results.
