The CatSper channel mediates progesterone-induced Ca2+ influx in human sperm
In the oviduct, cumulus cells that surround the oocyte release progesterone. In human sperm, progesterone stimulates a Ca2+ increase by a non-genomic mechanism(1-3). The Ca2+ signal has been proposed to control chemotaxis, hyperactivation and acrosomal exocytosis of sperm(4-8). However, the underlying signalling mechanism has remained mysterious. Here we show that progesterone activates the sperm-specific, pH-sensitive CatSper Ca2+ channel(9-11). We found that both progesterone and alkaline pH stimulate a rapid Ca2+ influx with almost no latency, incompatible with a signalling pathway involving metabotropic receptors and second messengers. The Ca2+ signals evoked by alkaline pH and progesterone are inhibited by the Ca-v channel blockers NNC 55-0396 and mibefradil. Patch-clamp recordings from sperm reveal an alkaline-activated current carried by mono-and divalent ions that exhibits all the hallmarks of sperm-specific CatSper Ca2+ channels(10,11). Progesterone substantially enhances the CatSper current. The alkaline- and progesterone-activated CatSper current is inhibited by both drugs. Our results resolve a long-standing controversy over the non-genomic progesterone signalling. In human sperm, either the CatSper channel itself or an associated protein serves as the non-genomic progesterone receptor. The identification of CatSper channel blockers will greatly facilitate the study of Ca2+ signalling in sperm and help to define further the physiological role of progesterone and CatSper.
