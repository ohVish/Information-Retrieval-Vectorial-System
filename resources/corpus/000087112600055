Role for rapid dendritic protein synthesis in hippocampal mGluR-dependent long-term depression
A hippocampal pyramidal neuron receives more than 10(4) excitatory glutamatergic synapses. Many of these synapses contain the molecular machinery for messenger RNA translation, suggesting that the protein complement (and thus function) of each synapse can be regulated on the basis of activity. Here, Local postsynaptic protein synthesis, triggered by synaptic activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors, was found to modify synaptic transmission within minutes.
