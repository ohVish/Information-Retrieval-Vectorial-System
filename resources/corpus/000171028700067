Direct measurement of the preferred sense of NO rotation after collision with argon
The preferred sense of product molecule rotation (clockwise or counterclockwise) in a bimolecular collision system has been measured. Rotationally inelastic collisions of nitric oxide (NO) molecules with Ar atoms were studied by combining crossed molecular beams, circularly polarized resonant multiphoton ionization probing, and velocity-mapped ion imaging detection. The observed sense of NO product rotation varies with deflection angle and is a strong function of the NO final rotational state. The largest preferences for sense of rotation are observed at the highest kinematically allowed product rotational states; for tower rotational states, the variation with deflection angle becomes oscillatory. Quantum calculations on the most recently reported NO-Ar potential give good agreement with the observed oscillation patterns in the sense of rotation.
