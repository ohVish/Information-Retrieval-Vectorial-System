Graphoepitaxy of self-assembled block copolymers on two-dimensional periodic patterned templates
Self- assembling materials are the building blocks of bottom- up nanofabrication processes, but they need to be templated to impose long- range order and eliminate defects. In this work, the self- assembly of a thin film of a spherical- morphology block copolymer is templated using an array of nanoscale topographical elements that act as surrogates for the minority domains of the block copolymer. The orientation and periodicity of the resulting array of spherical microdomains are governed by the commensurability between the block copolymer period and the template period and is accurately described by a free- energy model. This method, which forms high- spatial-frequency arrays using a lower- spatial- frequency template, will be useful in nanolithography applications such as the formation of high- density microelectronic structures.
