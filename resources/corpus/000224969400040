Energetics of hydrogen bond network rearrangements in liquid water
A strong temperature dependence of oxygen K-edge x-ray absorption fine structure features was observed for supercooled and normal liquid water droplets prepared from the breakup of a liquid microjet. Analysis of the data over the temperature range 251 to 288 kelvin (-22degrees to +15degreesC) yields a value of 1.5+/-0.5 kilocalories per mote for the average thermal energy required to effect an observable rearrangement between the fully coordinated ("ice-like") and distorted ("broken-donor") local hydrogen-bonding configurations responsible for the pre-edge and post-edge features, respectively. This energy equals the latent heat of melting of ice with hexagonal symmetry (ice 1=lh) and is consistent with the distribution of hydrogen bond strengths obtained for the "overstructured" ST2 model of water.
