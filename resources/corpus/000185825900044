A neurexin-related protein, BAM-2, terminates axonal branches in C-elegans
Neuronal axons connect to multiple target cells through the formation of collateral branches, but the mechanisms that regulate this process are largely unknown. We show that BAM-2, a neurexin-related transmembrane protein, is required for development of VC motoneuron branches in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans. Expression analysis and ectopic expression experiments suggest that BAM-2 functions as a branch termination cue and reveal a mechanism for selective control of branches that sprout off a primary axon.
