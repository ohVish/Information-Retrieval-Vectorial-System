Possible displacement of the climate signal in ancient ice by premelting and anomalous diffusion
The best high-resolution records of climate over the past few hundred millennia are derived from ice cores retrieved from Greenland and Antarctica(1-3). The interpretation of these records relies on the assumption that the trace constituents used as proxies for past climate have undergone only modest post-depositional migration. Many of the constituents are soluble impurities found principally in unfrozen liquid that separates the grain boundaries in ice sheets. This phase behaviour, termed premelting, is characteristic of polycrystalline material(4,5). Here we show that premelting influences compositional diffusion in a manner that causes the advection of impurity anomalies towards warmer regions while maintaining their spatial integrity. Notwithstanding chemical reactions that might rx certain species against this prevailing transport, we rnd that-under conditions that resemble those encountered in the Eemian interglacial ice of central Greenland (from about 125,000 to 115,000 years ago)-impurity fluctuations may be separated from ice of the same age by as much as 50 cm. This distance is comparable to the ice thickness of the contested sudden cooling events in Eemian ice from the GRIP core.
