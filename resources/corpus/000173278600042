Remarkably selective iridium catalysts for the elaboration of aromatic C-H bonds
Arylboron compounds have intriguing properties and are important building blocks for chemical synthesis. A family of Ir catalysts now enables the direct synthesis of arylboron compounds from aromatic hydrocarbons and boranes under "solventless" conditions. The Ir catalysts are highly selective for C-H activation and do not interfere with subsequent in situ transformations, including Pd-mediated cross-couplings with aryl halides. By virtue of their favorable activities and exceptional selectivities, these Ir catalysts impart the synthetic versatility of arylboron reagents to C-H bonds in aromatic and heteroaromatic hydrocarbons.
