CRASY: Mass- or Electron-Correlated Rotational Alignment Spectroscopy
Rotational spectra have traditionally been measured without a concurrent means of differentiating the molecular constituents of the sample. Here, we present an all-optical multipulse experiment that allows the correlated measurement of rotational and mass or photoelectron spectra by combining Fourier transform rotational coherence spectroscopy with resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization. We demonstrate the power of this method with the determination of ground-state rotational constants and fragmentation channels for 10 different isotopes in a natural carbon disulfide sample. Three of the reported rotational constants were previously inaccessible by conventional spectroscopic techniques.
