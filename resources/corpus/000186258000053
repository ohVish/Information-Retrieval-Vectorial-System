Flexible retinotopy: Motion-dependent position coding in the visual cortex
Although the visual cortex is organized retinotopically, it is not clear whether the cortical representation of position necessarily reflects perceived position. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we show that the retinotopic representation of a stationary object in the cortex was systematically shifted when visual motion was present in the scene. Whereas the object could appear shifted in the direction of the visual motion, the representation of the object in the visual cortex was always shifted in the opposite direction. The results show that the representation of position in the primary visual cortex, as revealed by fMRI, can be dissociated from perceived location.
