1D-1D Coulomb Drag Signature of a Luttinger Liquid
One-dimensional (1D) interacting electronic systems exhibit distinct properties when compared to their counterparts in higher dimensions. We report Coulomb drag measurements between vertically integrated quantum wires separated by a barrier only 15 nanometers wide. The temperature dependence of the drag resistance is measured in the true 1D regime where both wires have less than one 1D subband occupied. As a function of temperature, an upturn in the drag resistance is observed below a temperature T* similar to 1.6 kelvin. This crossover in Coulomb drag behavior is consistent with Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid models for the 1D-1D drag between quantum wires.
