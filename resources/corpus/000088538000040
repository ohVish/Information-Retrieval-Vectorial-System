Quasi-planar nucleus structure in apoferritin crystallization
First-order phase transitions of matter, such as condensation and crystallization, proceed through the formation and subsequent growth of 'critical nuclei' of the new phase. The thermodynamics and kinetics of the formation of these critical nuclei depend on their structure, which is often assumed to be a compact, three-dimensional arrangement of the constituent molecules or atoms(5,6). Recent molecular dynamics simulations have predicted compact nucleus structures for matter made up of building blocks with a spherical interaction field(7,8), whereas strongly anisotropic, dipolar molecules may form nuclei consisting of single chains of molecules(9). Here we show, using direct atomic force microscopy observations, that the near-critical-size clusters formed during the crystallization of apoferritin, a quasi-spherical protein, and which are representative of the critical nucleus of this system, consist of planar arrays of one or two monomolecular layers that contain 5-10 rods of up to 7 molecules each. We rnd that these clusters contain between 20 and 50 molecules each, and that the arrangement of the constituent molecules is identical to that found in apoferritin crystals. We anticipate that similarly unexpected critical nucleus structures may be quite common, particularly with anisotropic molecules, suggesting that advanced nucleation theories should treat the critical nucleus structure as a variable.
