Superconductivity in molecular crystals induced by charge injection (Retracted article. See vol 422 pg 93 2003)
Progress in the field of superconductivity is often linked to the discovery of new classes of materials, with the layered copper oxides(1) being a particularly impressive example. The superconductors known today include a wide spectrum of materials, ranging in complexity from simple elemental metals, to alloys and binary compounds of metals, to multi-component compounds of metals and chalcogens or metalloids, doped fullerenes and organic charge-transfer salts. Here we present a new class of superconductors: insulating organic molecular crystals that are made metallic through charge injection. The first examples are pentacene, tetracene and anthracene, the last having the highest transition temperature, at 4 K. We anticipate that many other organic molecular crystals can also be made superconducting by this method, which will lead to surprising findings in the vast composition space of molecular crystals.
