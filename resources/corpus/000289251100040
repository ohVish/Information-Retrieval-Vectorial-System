The Electron-Pairing Mechanism of Iron-Based Superconductors
The past three years have witnessed the discovery of a series of novel high-temperature superconductors. Trailing behind the cuprates, these iron-based compounds are the second-highest-temperature superconducting material family known to date. Despite the marked differences in the chemical composition, these materials share many properties with the cuprates and offer the hope of finally unveiling the secret of high-temperature superconductivity. The main theme of this review is the electron-pairing mechanism responsible for their superconductivity. We discuss the progress in this young field and point out the open issues.
