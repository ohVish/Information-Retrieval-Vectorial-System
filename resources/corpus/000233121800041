Meteorite phosphates show constant Lu-176 decay rate since 4557 million years ago
The use,of radioactive decay of Lu-176 to Hf-176 to study the evolution of the Earth requires a precise and accurate value for the Lu-176 decay constant. Recent determinations of this decay constant by age comparison to the more precisely calibrated U-Pb isotopic system produced internally consistent but discrepant values between terrestrial minerals and meteorites. New highly radiogenic Lu-Hf data for phosphate minerals from Richardton (ordinary chondrite) and Acapulco (primitive achondrite) yield decay constant values of 1.864 x 10(-11) +/- 0.016 x 10(-11) and 1.832 x 10(-11) +/- 0.029 x 10(-11) year(-1), respectively, identical to the value determined from terrestrial minerals.
