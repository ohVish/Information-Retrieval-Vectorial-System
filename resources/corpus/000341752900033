Spectroscopic observation of SU(N)-symmetric interactions in Sr orbital magnetism
SU(N) symmetry can emerge in a quantum system with N single-particle spin states when spin is decoupled from interparticle interactions. Taking advantage of the high measurement precision offered by an ultrastable laser, we report a spectroscopic observation of SU(N <= 10) symmetry in Sr-87. By encoding the electronic orbital degree of freedom in two clock states while keeping the system open to as many as 10 nuclear spin sublevels, we probed the non-equilibrium two-orbital SU(N) magnetism via Ramsey spectroscopy of atoms confined in an array of two-dimensional optical traps; we studied the spin-orbital quantum dynamics and determined the relevant interaction parameters. This study lays the groundwork for using alkaline-earth atoms as testbeds for important orbital models.
