Inflammasomes in health and disease
Inflammasomes are a group of protein complexes built around several proteins, including NLRP3, NLRC4, AIM2 and NLRP6. Recognition of a diverse range of microbial, stress and damage signals by inflammasomes results in direct activation of caspase-1, which subsequently induces secretion of potent pro-inflammatory cytokines and a form of cell death called pyroptosis. Inflammasome-mediated processes are important during microbial infections and also in regulating both metabolic processes and mucosal immune responses. We review the functions of the different inflammasome complexes and discuss how aberrations in them are implicated in the pathogenesis of human diseases.
