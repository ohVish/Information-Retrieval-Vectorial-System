Evidence for persistent flow and aqueous sedimentation on early Mars
Landforms representative of sedimentary processes and environments that occurred early in martian history have been recognized in Mars Global Surveyor Mars Orbiter Camera and Mars Odyssey Thermal Emission Imaging System images. Evidence of distributary, channelized flow (in particular, flow that lasted long enough to foster meandering) and the resulting deposition of a fan-shaped apron of debris indicate persistent flow conditions and formation of at least some large intracrater layered sedimentary sequences within fluvial, and potentially lacustrine, environments.
