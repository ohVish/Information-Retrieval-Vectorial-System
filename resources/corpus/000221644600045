Genomes for medicine
We have the human genome sequence. It is freely available, accurate and nearly complete. But is the genome ready for medicine? The new resource is already changing genetic research strategies to find information of medical value. Now we need high-quality annotation of all the functionally important sequences and the variations within them that contribute to health and disease. To achieve this, we need more genome sequences, systematic experimental analyses, and extensive information on human phenotypes. Flexible and user-friendly access to well-annotated genomes will create an environment for innovation, and the potential for unlimited use of sequencing in biomedical research and practice.
