Negligible effect of ions on the hydrogen-bond structure in liquid water
The effects of ions on bulk properties of liquid water, such as viscosity, have suggested that ions alter water's hydrogen-bonding network. We measured the orientational correlation time of water molecules in Mg(ClO4)(2), NaClO4, and Na2SO4 solutions by means of femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy. The addition of ions had no influence on the rotational dynamics of water molecules outside the first solvation shells of the ions. This result shows that the presence of ions does not lead to an enhancement or a breakdown of the hydrogen-bond network in liquid water.
