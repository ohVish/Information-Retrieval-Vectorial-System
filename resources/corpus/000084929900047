A H+-gated urea channel: The link between Helicobacter pylori urease and gastric colonization
Acidic media trigger cytoplasmic urease activity of the unique human gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori. Deletion of urel prevents this activation of cytoplasmic urease that is essential for bacterial acid resistance. Urel is an inner membrane protein with six transmembrane segments as shown by in vitro transcription/translation and membrane separation. Expression of Urel in Xenopus oocytes results in acid-stimulated urea uptake, with a pH profile similar to activation of cytoplasmic urease, Mutation of periplasmic histidine 123 abolishes stimulation. Urel-mediated transport is urea specific, passive, nonsaturable, nonelectrogenic, and temperature independent. Urel functions as a H+-gated urea channel regulating cytoplasmic urease that is essential for gastric survival and colonization.
