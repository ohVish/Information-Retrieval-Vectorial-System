Principles of ubiquitin and SUMO modifications in DNA repair
With the discovery in the late 1980s that the DNA-repair gene RAD6 encodes a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, it became clear that protein modification by ubiquitin conjugation has a much broader significance than had previously been assumed. Now, two decades later, ubiquitin and its cousin SUMO are implicated in a range of human diseases, including breast cancer and Fanconi anaemia, giving fresh momentum to studies focused on the relationships between ubiquitin, SUMO and DNA-repair pathways.
