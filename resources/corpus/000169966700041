Remotely sensed biological production in the equatorial Pacific
A combination of ship, buoy, and satellite observations in the tropical Pacific during the period from 1992 to 2000 provides a basin-scale perspective on the net effects of El Nino and La Nina on biogeochemical cycles. New biological production during the 1997-99 El Nino/La Nina period varied by more than a factor of 2, The resulting interannual changes in global carbon sequestration associated with the El Nino/La Nina cycle contributed to the Largest known natural perturbation of the global carbon cycle over these time scales.
