The I kappa B-NF-kappa B signaling module: Temporal control and selective gene activation
Nuclear localization of the transcriptional activator NFkappa-B (nuclear factor kappaB) is controlled in mammalian cells by three isoforms of NF-kappaB inhibitor protein: IkappaBalpha, -beta, and -epsilon. Based on simplifying reductions of the IkappaB-NF-kappaB signaling module in knockout cell lines, we present a computational model that describes the temporal control of NF-kappaB activation by the coordinated degradation and synthesis of IkappaB proteins. The model demonstrates that IkappaBalpha is responsible for strong negative feedback that allows for a fast turn-off of the NF-kappaB response, whereas IkappaBbeta and -epsilon function to reduce the system's oscillatory potential and stabilize NF-kappaB responses during longer stimulations. Bimodal signal-processing characteristics with respect to stimulus duration are revealed by the model and are shown to generate specificity in gene expression.
