Role of predicted metalloprotease motif of Jab1/Csn5 in cleavage of Nedd8 from Cul1
COP9 signalosome (CSN) cleaves the ubiquitin-like protein Nedd8 from the Cul1 subunit of SCF ubiquitin ligases. The Jab1/MPN domain metalloenzyme (JAMM) motif in the Jab1/Csn5 subunit was found to underlie CSN's Nedd8 isopeptidase activity. JAMM is found in proteins from archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes, including the Rpn11 subunit of the 26 S proteasome. Metal chelators and point mutations within JAMM abolished CSN-dependent cleavage of Nedd8 from Cul1, yet had little effect on CSN complex assembly. Optimal SCF activity in yeast and both viability and proper photoreceptor cell ( R cell) development in Drosophila melanogaster required an intact Csn5 JAMM domain. We propose that JAMM isopeptidases play important roles in a variety of physiological pathways.
