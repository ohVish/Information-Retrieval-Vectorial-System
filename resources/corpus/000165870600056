Global analysis of the genetic network controlling a bacterial cell cycle
This report presents full-genome evidence that bacterial cells use discrete transcription patterns to control cell cycle progression. Global transcription analysis of synchronized Caulobacter crescentus cells was used to identify 553 genes (19% of the genome) whose messenger RNA Levels varied as a function of the cell cycle. We conclude that in bacteria, as in yeast, (i) genes involved in a given cell function are activated at the time of execution of that function, (ii) genes encoding proteins that function in complexes are coexpressed, and (iii) temporal cascades of gene expression control multiprotein structure biogenesis. A single regulatory factor, the CtrA member of the two-component signal transduction family, is directly or indirectly involved in the control of 26% of the cell cycle-regulated genes.
