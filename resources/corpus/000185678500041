The anomalous Hall effect and magnetic monopoles in momentum space
Efforts to find the magnetic monopole in real space have been made in cosmic rays and in particle accelerators, but there has not yet been any firm evidence for its existence because of its very heavy mass, similar to10(16) giga-electron volts. We show that the magnetic monopole can appear in the crystal momentum space of solids in the accessible low-energy region (similar to0.1 to 1 electron volts) in the context of the anomalous Hall effect. We report experimental results together with first-principles calculations on the ferromagnetic crystal SrRuO3 that provide evidence for the magnetic monopole in the crystal momentum space.
