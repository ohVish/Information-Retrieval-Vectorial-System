Reversal of obesity- and diet-induced insulin resistance with salicylates or targeted disruption of IKK beta
We show that high doses of salicylates reverse hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and dyslipidemia in obese rodents by sensitizing insulin signaling. Activation or overexpression of the I kappaB kinase beta (IKK beta) attenuated insulin signaling in cultured cells, whereas IKK beta inhibition reversed insulin resistance. Thus, IKK beta, rather than the cyclooxygenases, appears to be the relevant molecular target. Heterozygous deletion (Ikk beta (+/-)) protected against the development of insulin resistance during high-fat feeding and in obese Lep(ob/ob) mice. These findings implicate an inflammatory process in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus and identify the IKK beta pathway as a target for insulin sensitization.
