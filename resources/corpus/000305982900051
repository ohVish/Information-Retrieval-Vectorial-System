The signature of the first stars in atomic hydrogen at redshift 20
Dark and baryonic matter moved at different velocities in the early Universe, which strongly suppressed star formation in some regions(1). This was estimated(2) to imprint a large-scale fluctuation signal of about two millikelvin in the 21-centimetre spectral line of atomic hydrogen associated with stars at a redshift of 20, although this estimate ignored the critical contribution of gas heating due to X-rays(3,4) and major enhancements of the suppression. A large velocity difference reduces the abundance of haloes(1,5,6) and requires the first stars to form in haloes of about a million solar masses(7,8), substantially greater than previously expected(9,10). Here we report a simulation of the distribution of the first stars at redshift 20 (cosmic age of around 180 million years), incorporating all these ingredients within a 400-megaparsec box. We find that the 21-centimetre hydrogen signature of these stars is an enhanced (ten millikelvin) fluctuation signal on the hundred-megaparsec scale, characterized(2) by a flat power spectrum with prominent baryon acoustic oscillations. The required sensitivity to see this signal is achievable with an integration time of a thousand hours with an instrument like the Murchison Wide-field Array(11) or the Low Frequency Array(12) but designed to operate in the range of 50-100 megahertz.
