Continental-scale partitioning of fire emissions during the 1997 to 2001 El Nino/La Nina period
During the 1997 to 1998 El Nino, drought conditions triggered widespread increases in. re activity, releasing CH(4) and CO(2) to the atmosphere. We evaluated the contribution of. res from different continents to variability in these greenhouse gases from 1997 to 2001, using satellite-based estimates of. re activity, biogeochemical modeling, and an inverse analysis of atmospheric CO anomalies. During the 1997 to 1998 El Nino, the. re emissions anomaly was 2.1 +/- 0.8 petagrams of carbon, or 66 +/- 24% of the CO(2) growth rate anomaly. The main contributors were Southeast Asia (60%), Central and South America (30%), and boreal regions of Eurasia and North America (10%).
