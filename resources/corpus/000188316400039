T cell activation by lipopeptide antigens
Unlike major histocompatibility proteins, which bind peptides, CD1 proteins display lipid antigens to T cells. Here, we report that CD1a presents a family of previously unknown lipopeptides from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, named didehydroxymycobactins because of their structural relation to mycobactin siderophores. T cell activation was mediated by the alphabeta T cell receptors and was specific for structure of the acyl and peptidic components of these antigens. These studies identify a means of intracellular pathogen detection and identify lipopeptides as a biochemical class of antigens for T cells, which, like conventional peptides, have a potential for marked structural diversity.
