Atomic-scale coupling of photons to single-molecule junctions
Spatial resolution at the atomic scale has been achieved in the coupling of light to single molecules adsorbed on a surface. Electron transfer to a single molecule induced by green to near-infrared light in the junction of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) exhibited spatially varying probability that is confined within the molecule. The mechanism involves photo-induced resonant tunneling in which a photoexcited electron in the STM tip is transferred to the molecule. The coupling of photons to the tunneling process provides a pathway to explore molecular dynamics with the combined capabilities of lasers and the STM.
