Discovery of hidden blazars
Every radio-loud quasar may have blazar activities, according to a unified scheme where the differences in both optical and radio observations of radio-loud quasars are the result of different viewing angles, We have predicted that blazars may be detected using emission line ratio variations caused by variable illumination of gas clouds in the broad emission line region. In a spectroscopic search of 62 quasars at a redshift of about 2, we have discovered large (>20%) variations of the emission tine ratios, CIV/CIII] or CIV/Ly alpha, when compared with data taken more than 10 years ago. This result is consistent with our prediction and supports the unification scheme for radio-loud quasars.
