A TAS1R receptor-based explanation of sweet 'water-taste'
Water-tastes' are gustatory after-impressions elicited by water following the removal of a chemical solution from the mouth, akin to colour after-images appearing on 'white' paper after fixation on coloured images. Unlike colour after-images, gustatory aftereffects are poorly understood(1). One theory posits that 'water-tastes' are adaptation phenomena, in which adaptation to one taste solution causes the water presented subsequently to act as a taste stimulus(2,3). An alternative hypothesis is that removal of the stimulus upon rinsing generates a receptor-based, positive, off-response in taste-receptor cells, ultimately inducing a gustatory perception(4). Here we show that a sweet 'water-taste' is elicited when sweet-taste inhibitors are rinsed away. Responses of cultured cells expressing the human sweetener receptor directly parallel the psychophysical responses - water rinses remove the inhibitor from the heteromeric sweetener receptor TAS1R2 - TAS1R3, which activates cells and results in the perception of strong sweetness from pure water. This 'rebound' activity occurs when equilibrium forces on the two-state allosteric sweet receptors result in their coordinated shift to the activated state upon being released from inhibition by rinsing(5-7).
