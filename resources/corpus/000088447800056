Altered nociceptive neuronal circuits after neonatal peripheral inflammation
Nociceptive neuronal circuits are formed during embryonic and postnatal times when painful stimuli are normally absent or Limited. Today, medical procedures for neonates with health risks can involve tissue injury and pain for which the Long-term effects are unknown. To investigate the impact of neonatal tissue injury and pain on development of nociceptive neuronal circuitry, we used an animal model of persistent hind paw peripheral inflammation, We found that, as adults, these animals exhibited spinal neuronal circuits with increased input and segmental changes in nociceptive primary afferent axons and altered responses to sensory stimulation.
