Synaptic plasticity in spinal lamina I projection neurons that mediate hyperalgesia
Inflammation, trauma, or nerve injury may cause enduring hyperalgesia, an enhanced sensitivity to painful stimuli. Neurons in lamina I of the spinal dorsal horn that express the neurokinin 1 receptor for substance P mediate this abnormal pain sensitivity by an unknown cellular mechanism. We report that in these, but not in other nociceptive lamina I cells, neurokinin 1 receptor-activated signal transduction pathways and activation of low-threshold (T-type) voltage-gated calcium channels synergistically facilitate activity- and calcium-dependent long-term potentiation at synapses from nociceptive nerve fibers. Thereby, memory traces of painful events are retained.
