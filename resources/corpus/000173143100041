Electrically driven single-photon source
Electroluminescence from a single quantum dot within the intrinsic region of a p-i-n junction is shown to act as an electrically driven single-photon source. At low injection currents, the dot electroluminescence spectrum reveals a single sharp line due to exciton recombination, white another tine due to the biexciton emerges at higher currents. The second-order correlation function of the diode displays anti-bunching under a continuous drive current. Single-photon emission is stimulated by subnanosecond voltage pulses. These results suggest that semiconductor technology can be used to mass-produce a single-photon source for applications in quantum information technology.
