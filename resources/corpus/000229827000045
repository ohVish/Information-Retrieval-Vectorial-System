Latest advances in understanding preeclampsia
Preeclampsia is a relatively common pregnancy disorder that originates in the placenta and causes variable maternal and fetal problems. In the worst cases, it may threaten the survival of both mother and baby. We summarize recent work on the causes of preeclampsia, which reveals a new mode of maternal immune recognition of the fetus, relevant to the condition. The circulating factors derived from the placenta, which contributes to the clinical syndrome, are now better understood. This brief review on preeclampsia does not cover all aspects of this intriguing condition but focuses on some new and interesting findings.
