Genetic loci affecting resistance to human malaria parasites in a West African mosquito vector population
Successful propagation of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum within a susceptible mosquito vector is prerequisite for the transmission of malaria. A field-based genetic analysis of the major human malaria vector, Anopheles gambiae, has revealed natural factors that reduce the transmission of P. falciparum. Differences in P. falciparum oocyst numbers between mosquito isofemale families fed on the same infected blood indicated large genetic component affecting resistance to the parasite, and genome-wide scanning in pedigrees of wild mosquitoes detected segregating resistance alleles. The apparently high natural frequency of resistance alleles suggests that malaria parasites (or similar pathogen) exert significant selective pressure on vector populations.
