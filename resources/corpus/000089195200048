Scanometric DNA array detection with nanoparticle probes
A method for analyzing combinatorial DNA arrays using oligonucleotide-modified gold nanoparticle probes and a conventional flatbed scanner is described here. Labeling oligonucleotide targets with nanoparticle rather than fluorophore probes substantially alters the melting profiles of the target; from an array substrate. This difference permits the discrimination of an oligonucleotide sequence from targets with single nucleotide mismatches with a selectivity that is over three times that observed for fluorophore-labeled targets. In addition, when coupled with a signal amplification method based on nanoparticle-promoted reduction of silver(I), the sensitivity of this scanometric array detection system exceeds that of the analogous fluorophore system by two orders of magnitude.
