Cell type regulates selective segregation of mouse chromosome 7 DNA strands in mitosis
After chromosome replication, sister chromatid copies are generally thought to segregate randomly to daughter cells. However, sister chromatids differ in their DNA strands, with each chromatid inheriting one older strand that is paired to a newly synthesized strand. Genetic analysis with a homologous chromosome pair indicated nonrandom chromatid distribution in embryonic stem cells. Biased segregation pattern was also found in all 100 endoderm cells examined, but not in any of the 165 neuroectoderm cells. In contrast, the mesoderm, cardiomyocyte, and pancreatic cells exhibited a random mode of segregation. Strand distribution mechanisms regulated by cell, type may have consequences for cellular differentiation and for evolving strategies for developmental mechanisms.
