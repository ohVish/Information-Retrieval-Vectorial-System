Structure and receptor specificity of the hemagglutinin from an H5N1 influenza virus
The hemagglutinin (HA) structure at 2.9 angstrom resolution, from a highly pathogenic Vietnamese H5N1 influenza virus, is more related to the 1918 and other human H1 HAS than to a 1997 duck H5 HA. Glycan microarray analysis of this Viet04 HA reveals an avian alpha 2-3 sialic acid receptor binding preference. Introduction of mutations that can convert H1 serotype HAS to human alpha 2-6 receptor specificity only enhanced or reduced affinity for avian-type receptors. However, mutations that can convert avian H2 and H3 HAS to human receptor specificity, when inserted onto the Viet04 H5 HA framework, permitted binding to a natural human alpha 2-6 glycan, which suggests a path for this H5N1 virus to gain a foothold in the human population.
