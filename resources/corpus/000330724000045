Local Impermeant Anions Establish the Neuronal Chloride Concentration
Neuronal intracellular chloride concentration [Cl-](i) is an important determinant of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptor (GABA(A)R)-mediated inhibition and cytoplasmic volume regulation. Equilibrative cation-chloride cotransporters (CCCs) move Cl- across the membrane, but accumulating evidence suggests factors other than the bulk concentrations of transported ions determine [Cl-](i). Measurement of [Cl-](i) in murine brain slice preparations expressing the transgenic fluorophore Clomeleon demonstrated that cytoplasmic impermeant anions ([A](i)) and polyanionic extracellular matrix glycoproteins ([A](o)) constrain the local [Cl-]. CCC inhibition had modest effects on [Cl-] i and neuronal volume, but substantial changes were produced by alterations of the balance between [A](i) and [A](o). Therefore, CCCs are important elements of Cl- homeostasis, but local impermeant anions determine the homeostatic set point for [Cl-], and hence, neuronal volume and the polarity of local GABA(A)R signaling.
