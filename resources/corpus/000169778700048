The dating of shallow faults in the Earth's crust
Direct dating of ductile shear zones and calculation of uplift/exhumation rates can be done using various radiometric dating techniques. But radiometric dating of shallow crustal faulting, which occurs in the crust's brittle regime, has remained difficult(1-4) because the low temperatures typical of shallow crusted faults prevent the complete syntectonic mineral recrystallization that occurs in deeper faults. Both old (detrital) and newly grown (authigenic) fine-grained phyllosilicates are thus preserved in shallow fault zones and therefore their radiometric ages reflect a mixture of both mineral populations. Also, the loss of Ar-39 during neutron irradiation in dating of clay minerals can produce erroneously old ages. Here we present a method of characterizing the clay populations in fault gouge, using X-ray modelling, combined with sample encapsulation, and show how it can be used to date near-surface fault activity reliably. We examine fault gouge from the Lewis thrust of the southern Canadian Rockies, which we determine to be similar to 52 Myr old. This result requires the western North America stress regime to have changed from contraction to extension in only a few million years during the Eocene. We also estimate the uplift/exhumation age and sedimentary source of these rocks to be similar to 172 Myr.
