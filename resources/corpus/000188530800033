Extinct technetium in silicon carbide stardust grains: Implications for stellar nucleosynthesis
The isotopic composition of ruthenium (Ru) in individual presolar silicon carbide (SiC) stardust grains bears the signature of s-process nucleosynthesis in asymptotic giant branch stars, plus an anomaly in Ru-99 that is explained by the in situ decay of technetium isotope Tc-99 in the grains. This finding, coupled with the observation of Tc spectral lines in certain stars, shows that the majority of presolar SiC grains come from low-mass asymptotic giant branch stars, and that the amount of Tc-99 produced in such stars is insufficient to have left a detectable Ru-99 anomaly in early solar system materials.
