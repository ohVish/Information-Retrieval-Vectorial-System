Zircon Dating of Oceanic Crustal Accretion
Most of Earth's present- day crust formed at mid- ocean ridges. High- precision uranium- lead dating of zircons in gabbros from the Vema Fracture Zone on the Mid- Atlantic Ridge reveals that the crust there grew in a highly regular pattern characterized by shallow melt delivery. Combined with results from previous dating studies, this finding suggests that two distinct modes of crustal accretion occur along slow- spreading ridges. Individual samples record a zircon date range of 90,000 to 235,000 years, which is interpreted to reflect the time scale of zircon crystallization in oceanic plutonic rocks.
