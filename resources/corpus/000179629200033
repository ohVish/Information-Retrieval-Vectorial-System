Anterior-posterior polarity in C-elegans and Drosophila - PARallels and differences
The eggs of Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila bear little similarity to each other, yet both depend on the par genes for control of anterior-posterior polarity. Here we explore possible common roles for the par genes (pars) in converting transient asymmetries into stably polarized axes. Although clear mechanistic parallels remain to be established, par-dependent regulation of microtubule dynamics and protein stability emerge as common themes.
