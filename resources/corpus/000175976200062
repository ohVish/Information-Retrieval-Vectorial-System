Control of stomatal distribution on the Arabidopsis leaf surface
Stomata regulate gas exchange and are distributed across the leaf epidermis with characteristic spacing. Arabidopsis stomata are produced by asymmetric cell divisions. Mutations in the gene TOO MANY MOUTHS (TMM) disrupt patterning by randomizing the plane of formative asymmetric divisions and by permitting ectopic divisions. TMM encodes a leucine-rich repeat-containing receptor-like protein expressed in proliferative postprotodermal cells. TMM appears to function in a position-dependent signaling pathway that controls the plane of patterning divisions as well as the balance between stem cell renewal and differentiation in stomatal and epidermal development.
