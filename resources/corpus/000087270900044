Real-time observation of adsorbate atom motion above a metal surface
The dynamics of cesium atom motion above the copper(lll) surface following electronic excitation with light was studied with femtosecond (10(-15) seconds) time resolution. Unusual changes in the surface electronic structure within 160 femtoseconds after excitation, observed by time-resolved two-photon photo-emission spectroscopy, are attributed to atomic motion in a copper-cesium bond-breaking process. Describing the change in energy of the cesium antibonding state with a simple classical model provides information on the mechanical forces acting on cesium atoms that are "turned on" by photoexcitation. Within 160 femtoseconds, the copper-cesium bond extends by 0.35 angstrom from its equilibrium value.
