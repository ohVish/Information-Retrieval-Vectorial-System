Yeast Rtt109 promotes genome stability by acetylating histone H3 on lysine 56
Posttranslational modifications of the histone octamer play important roles in regulating responses to DNA damage. Here, we reveal that Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rtt109p promotes genome stability and resistance to DNA-damaging agents, and that it does this by functionally cooperating with the histone chaperone Asf1p to maintain normal chromatin structure. Furthermore, we show that, as for Asf1p, Rtt109p is required for histone H3 acetylation on lysine 56 (K56) in vivo. Moreover, we show that Rtt109p directly catalyzes this modification in vitro in a manner that is stimulated by Asf1p. These data establish Rtt109p as a member of a new class of histone acetyltransferases and show that its actions are critical for cell survival in the presence of DNA damage during S phase.
