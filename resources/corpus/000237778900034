Ras, PI(3)K and mTOR signalling controls tumour cell growth
All eukaryotic cells coordinate cell growth with the availability of nutrients in their environment. The mTOR protein kinase has emerged as a critical growth-control node, receiving stimulatory signals from Ras and phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K) downstream from growth factors, as well as nutrient inputs in the form of amino-acid, glucose and oxygen availability. Notably, components of the Ras and PI( 3) K signalling pathways are mutated in most human cancers. The preponderance of mutations in these interconnected pathways suggests that the loss of growth-control checkpoints and promotion of cell survival in nutrient-limited conditions may be an obligate event in tumorigenesis.
