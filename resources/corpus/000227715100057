The vacuolar Ca(2+)-activated channel TPC1 regulates germination and stomatal movement
Cytosolic free calcium ([Ca(2+)](cyt)) is a ubiquitous signalling component in plant cells(1). Numerous stimuli trigger sustained or transient elevations of [Ca(2+)](cyt) that evoke downstream stimulus-specific responses. Generation of [Ca(2+)](cyt) signals is effected through stimulus-induced opening of Ca(2+)-permeable ion channels that catalyse a flux of Ca(2+) into the cytosol from extracellular or intracellular stores. Many classes of Ca(2+) current have been characterized electrophysiologically in plant membranes(2). However, the identity of the ion channels that underlie these currents has until now remained obscure. Here we show that the TPC1 ('two-pore channel 1') gene of Arabidopsis thaliana encodes a class of Ca(2+)-dependent Ca(2+)-release channel that is known from numerous electrophysiological studies as the slow vacuolar channel(3-5). Slow vacuolar channels are ubiquitous in plant vacuoles, where they form the dominant conductance at micromolar [Ca(2+)](cyt). We show that a tpc1 knockout mutant lacks functional slow vacuolar channel activity and is defective in both abscisic acid-induced repression of germination and in the response of stomata to extracellular calcium. These studies unequivocally demonstrate a critical role of intracellular Ca(2+)-release channels in the physiological processes of plants.
