Ion-Mediated Electron Transfer in a Supramolecular Donor-Acceptor Ensemble
Ion binding often mediates electron transfer in biological systems as a cofactor strategy, either as a promoter or as an inhibitor. However, it has rarely, if ever, been exploited for that purpose in synthetic host-guest assemblies. We report here that strong binding of specific anions (chloride, bromide, and methylsulfate but not tetrafluoroborate or hexafluorophosphate) to a tetrathiafulvalene calix[4]pyrrole (TTF-C4P) donor enforces a host conformation that favors electron transfer to a bisimidazolium quinone (BIQ(2+)) guest acceptor. In contrast, the addition of a tetraethylammonium cation, which binds more effectively than the BIQ(2+) guest in the TTF-C4P cavity, leads to back electron transfer, restoring the initial oxidation states of the donor and acceptor pair. The products of these processes were characterized via spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography.
