Stable germline transformation of the malaria mosquito Anopheles stephensi
Anopheline mosquito species are obligatory vectors for human malaria, an infectious disease that affects hundreds of millions of people living in tropical and subtropical countries. The lack of a suitable gene transfer technology for these mosquitoes has hampered the molecular genetic analysis of their physiology, including the molecular interactions between the vector and the malaria parasite. Here we show that a transposon, based on the Minos element(1) and bearing exogenous DNA, can integrate efficiently and stably into the germ line of the human malaria vector Anopheles stephensi, through a transposase-mediated process.
