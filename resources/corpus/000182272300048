Cell division
In creating the mitotic spindle and the contractile ring, natural selection has engineered fascinating precision machines whose movements depend upon forces generated by ensembles of cytoskeletal proteins. These machines segregate chromosomes and divide the cell with high fidelity. Current research on the mechanisms and regulation of spindle morphogenesis, chromosome motility and cytokinesis emphasizes how ensembles of dynamic cytoskeletal polymers and multiple motors cooperate to generate the forces that guide the cell through mitosis and cytokinesis.
