Single-electron transmetalation in organoboron cross-coupling by photoredox/nickel dual catalysis
The routine application of C-sp3-hybridized nucleophiles in cross-coupling reactions remains an unsolved challenge in organic chemistry. The sluggish transmetalation rates observed for the preferred organoboron reagents in such transformations are a consequence of the two-electron mechanism underlying the standard catalytic approach. We describe a mechanistically distinct single-electron transfer-based strategy for the activation of organoboron reagents toward transmetalation that exhibits complementary reactivity patterns. Application of an iridium photoredox catalyst in tandem with a nickel catalyst effects the cross-coupling of potassium alkoxyalkyl- and benzyltrifluoroborates with an array of aryl bromides under exceptionally mild conditions (visible light, ambient temperature, no strong base). The transformation has been extended to the asymmetric and stereoconvergent cross-coupling of a secondary benzyltrifluoroborate.
