Negative Coulomb drag in a one-dimensional wire
We observed negative Coulomb drag for parallel coupled quantum wires, in which electrons flow in the opposite directions between the wires. This only occurred under the conditions of strong correlation in the wires, that is, low density, high magnetic field, and low temperature, and cannot be addressed by a standard theory of momentum transfer. We propose a Coulomb drag model in which formation of a Wigner crystal state in the drag wire and a particle-like state in the drive wire is taken into account.
