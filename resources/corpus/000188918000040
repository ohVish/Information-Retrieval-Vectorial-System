Renewable hydrogen from ethanol by autothermal reforming
Ethanol and ethanol-water mixtures were converted directly into H-2 with similar to100% selectivity and >95% conversion by catalytic partial oxidation, with a residence time on rhodium-ceria catalysts of <10 milliseconds. Rapid vaporization and mixing with air with an automotive fuel injector were performed at temperatures sufficiently low and times sufficiently fast that homogeneous reactions producing carbon, acetaldehyde, ethylene, and total combustion products can be minimized. This process has great potential for low-cost H-2 generation in fuel cells for small portable applications where liquid fuel storage is essential and where systems must be small, simple, and robust.
