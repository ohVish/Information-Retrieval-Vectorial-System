Unravelling hepatitis C virus replication from genome to function
Since the discovery of the hepatitis C virus over 15 years ago, scientists have raced to develop diagnostics, study the virus and find new therapies. Yet virtually every attempt to dissect this pathogen has met with roadblocks that impeded progress. Its replication was restricted to humans or experimentally infected chimpanzees, and efficient growth of the virus in cell culture failed until very recently. Nevertheless hard-fought progress has been made and the first wave of antiviral drugs is entering clinical trials.
