Aggresomes and autophagy generate sites for virus replication
The replication of many viruses is associated with specific intracellular compartments called virus factories or virioplasm. These are thought to provide a physical scaffold to concentrate viral components and thereby increase the efficiency of replication. The formation of virus replication sites often results in rearrangement of cellular membranes and reorganization of the cytoskeleton. Similar rearrangements are seen in cells in response to protein aggregation, where aggresomes and autophagosomes are produced to facilitate protein degradation. Here I review the evidence that some viruses induce aggresomes and autophagosomes to generate sites of replication.
