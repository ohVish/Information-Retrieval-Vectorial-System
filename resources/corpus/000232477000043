Nanoscale imaging of buried structures via scanning near-field ultrasound holography
A nondestructive imaging method, scanning near-field ultrasound holography (SNFUH), has been developed that provides depth information as well as spatial resolution at the 10- to 100-nanometer scale. In SNFUH, the phase and amplitude of the scattered specimen ultrasound wave, reflected in perturbation to the surface acoustic standing wave, are mapped with a scanning probe microscopy platform to provide nanoscale-resolution images of the internal substructure of diverse materials. We have used SNFUH to image buried nanostructures, to perform subsurface metrology in microelectronic structures, and to image malaria parasites in red blood cells.
