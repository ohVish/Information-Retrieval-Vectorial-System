Retromer Is Required for Apoptotic Cell Clearance by Phagocytic Receptor Recycling
The cell surface receptor CED-1 mediates apoptotic cell recognition by phagocytic cells, enabling cell corpse clearance in Caenorhabditis elegans. Here, we found that the C. elegans intracellular protein sorting complex, retromer, was required for cell corpse clearance by mediating the recycling of CED-1. Retromer was recruited to the surfaces of phagosomes containing cell corpses, and its loss of function caused defective cell corpse removal. The retromer probably acted through direct interaction with CED-1 in the cell corpse recognition pathway. In the absence of retromer function, CED-1 associated with lysosomes and failed to recycle from phagosomes and cytosol to the plasma membrane. Thus, retromer is an essential mediator of apoptotic cell clearance by regulating phagocytic receptor(s) during cell corpse engulfment.
