Modalities, Modes, and Models in Functional Neuroimaging
In this, the 21st century, human-brain mapping celebrates 21 years of cognitive activation studies. This review looks at imaging neuroscience and key ideas it has pursued; some ideas portend exciting developments, and others have failed gloriously. In terms of achievements, there is much to celebrate, in the sense that it is difficult to imagine modern neuroscience without brain imaging. I will look at recent advances from the perspectives of functional segregation and integration in the brain, paying special attention to approaches that deal with the distributed and integrated nature of neuronal processing and the questions they address.
