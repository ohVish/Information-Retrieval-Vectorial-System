c-di-AMP Secreted by Intracellular Listeria monocytogenes Activates a Host Type I Interferon Response
Intracellular bacterial pathogens, such as Listeria monocytogenes, are detected in the cytosol of host immune cells. Induction of this host response is often dependent on microbial secretion systems and, in L. monocytogenes, is dependent on multidrug efflux pumps (MDRs). Using L. monocytogenes mutants that overexpressed MDRs, we identified cyclic diadenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP) as a secreted molecule able to trigger the cytosolic host response. Overexpression of the di-adenylate cyclase, dacA (lmo2120), resulted in elevated levels of the host response during infection. c-di-AMP thus represents a putative bacterial secondary signaling molecule that triggers a cytosolic pathway of innate immunity and is predicted to be present in a wide variety of bacteria and archea.
