Molecular rulers for scaling down nanostructures
A method of constructing <30-nanometer structures in close proximity with precise spacings is presented that uses the step-by-step application of organic molecules and metal ions as size-controlled resists on predetermined patterns, such as those formed by electron-beam lithography. The organic molecules serve as a ruler for scaling down a Larger "parent" structure. After metal deposition and Lift-off of the organic multilayer resist, an isolated smaller structure remains on the surface. This approach is used to form thin parallel wires (15 to 70 nanometers in width and 1 micrometer long) of controlled thickness and spacing. The structures obtained were imaged with field emission scanning electron microscopy. A variety of nanostructures could be scaled down, including structures with hollow patterns.
