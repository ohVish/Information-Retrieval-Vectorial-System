Nonredundant Function of Soluble LT alpha(3) Produced by Innate Lymphoid Cells in Intestinal Homeostasis
Immunoglobulin A (IgA) production at mucosal surfaces contributes to protection against pathogens and controls intestinal microbiota composition. However, mechanisms regulating IgA induction are not completely defined. We show that soluble lymphotoxin alpha (sLT alpha(3)) produced by ROR gamma t(+) innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) controls T cell-dependent IgA induction in the lamina propria via regulation of T cell homing to the gut. By contrast, membrane-bound lymphotoxin beta (LT alpha(1)beta(2)) produced by ROR gamma t(+) ILCs is critical for T cell-independent IgA induction in the lamina propria via control of dendritic cell functions. Ablation of LT alpha in ROR gamma t(+) cells abrogated IgA production in the gut and altered microbiota composition. Thus, soluble and membrane-bound lymphotoxins produced by ILCs distinctly organize adaptive immune responses in the gut and control commensal microbiota composition.
