Ubiquitin-binding protein RAP80 mediates BRCA1-dependent DNA damage response
Mutations in the breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1) are associated with an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancers. BRCA1 participates in the cellular DNA damage response. We report the identification of receptor-associated protein 80 (RAP80) as a BRCA1-interacting protein in humans. RAP80 contains a tandem ubiquitin-interacting motif domain, which is required for its binding with ubiquitin in vitro and its damage-induced foci formation in vivo. Moreover, RAP80 specifically recruits BRCA1 to DNA damage sites and functions with BRCA1 in G(2)/M checkpoint control. Together, these results suggest the existence of a ubiquitination-dependent signaling pathway involved in the DNA damage response.
