Long-distance signaling in nodulation directed by a CLAVATA1-like receptor kinase
Proliferation of legume nodule primordia is controlled by shoot-root signaling known as autoregulation of nodulation (AON). Mutants defective in AON show supernodulation and increased numbers of lateral roots. Here, we demonstrate that AON in soybean is controlled by the receptor-like protein kinase GmNARK (Glycine max nodule autoregulation receptor kinase), similar to Arabidopsis CLAVATA1 (CLV1). Whereas CLV1 functions in a protein complex controlling stem cell proliferation by short-distance signaling in shoot apices, GmNARK expression in the leaf has a major role in long-distance communication with nodule and lateral root primordia.
