Semaphorin 3A is a chemoattractant for cortical apical dendrites
The apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons integrate inputs from various cortical layers and are central to information processing. Here we show that the growth of apical dendrites towards the pial surface is regulated by a diffusible chemoattractant present at high levels near the marginal zone. A major component of this signal is semaphorin 3A (Sema3A), which was previously characterized as a chemorepellant for cortical axons. Soluble guanylate cyclase is asymmetrically localized to the developing apical dendrite, and is required for the chemoattractive effect of Sema3A. Thus the asymmetric localization of soluble guanylate cyclase confers distinct Sema3A responses to axons and dendrites. These observations reveal a mechanism by which a single chemotropic signal can pattern both axons and dendrites during development.
