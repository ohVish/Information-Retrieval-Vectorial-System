The von Neumann relation generalized to coarsening of three-dimensional microstructures
Cellular structures or tessellations are ubiquitous in nature. Metals and ceramics commonly consist of space-filling arrays of single-crystal grains separated by a network of grain boundaries, and foams ( froths) are networks of gas-filled bubbles separated by liquid walls. Cellular structures also occur in biological tissue, and in magnetic, ferroelectric and complex fluid contexts. In many situations, the cell/grain/bubble walls move under the influence of their surface tension ( capillarity), with a velocity proportional to their mean curvature. As a result, the cells evolve and the structure coarsens. Over 50 years ago, von Neumann derived an exact formula for the growth rate of a cell in a two-dimensional cellular structure ( using the relation between wall velocity and mean curvature, the fact that three domain walls meet at 120 degrees and basic topology). This forms the basis of modern grain growth theory. Here we present an exact and much-sought extension of this result into three ( and higher) dimensions. The present results may lead to the development of predictive models for capillarity-driven microstructure evolution in a wide range of industrial and commercial processing scenarios - such as the heat treatment of metals, or even controlling the 'head' on a pint of beer.
