Nonresonant multiple spin echoes
Nonresonant manipulation of nuclear spins can probe large volumes of sample situated in inhomogeneous fields outside a magnet, a geometry suitable for mobile sensors for the inspection of roads, buildings, and geological formations. However, the interference by Earths magnetic field causes rapid decay of the signal within a few milliseconds for protons and is detrimental to this method. Here we describe a technique to suppress the effects of Earths field by using adiabatic rotations and sudden switching of the applied fields. We observed hundreds of spin echo signals lasting for more than 600 milliseconds and accurately measured the relaxation times of a liquid sample.
