Visible-light photocatalysis in nitrogen-doped titanium oxides
To use solar irradiation or interior Lighting efficiently, we sought a photocatalyst with high reactivity under visible Light. Films and powders of TiO2-XNX have revealed an improvement over titanium dioxide (TiO2) under visible Light (wavelength < 500 nanometers) in optical absorption and photocatalytic activity such as photodegradations of methylene blue and gaseous acetaldehyde and hydrophilicity of the film surface, Nitrogen doped into substitutional sites of TiO2 has proven to be indispensable for band-gap narrowing and photocatalytic activity, as assessed by first-principles calculations and x-ray photoemission spectroscopy.
