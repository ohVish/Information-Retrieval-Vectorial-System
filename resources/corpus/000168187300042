Laser altimetry of small-scale features on 433 Eros from NEAR-Shoemaker
During the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR)-Shoemaker's Low-altitude flyover of asteroid 433 Eros, observations by the NEAR Laser Rangefinder (NLR) have helped to characterize small-scale surface features. On scales from meters to hundreds of meters, the surface has a fractal structure with roughness dominated by blocks, structural features, and walls of small craters, This fractal structure suggests that a single process, possibly impacts, dominates surface morphology on these scales.
