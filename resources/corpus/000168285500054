Structure of the gating domain of a Ca2+-activated K+ channel complexed with Ca2+/calmodulin
Small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (SK channels)(1,2) are independent of voltage and gated solely by intracellular Ca2+. These membrane channels are heteromeric complexes that comprise pore-forming a-subunits and the Ca2+-binding protein calmodulin (CaM). CaM binds to the SK channel through the CaM-binding domain (CaMBD), which is located in an intracellular region of the a-subunit immediately carboxy-terminal to the pore(3,4). Channel opening is triggered when Ca2+ binds the EF hands in the N-lobe of CaM4. Here we report the 1.60 Angstrom crystal structure of the SK channel CaMBD/Ca2+/CaM complex. The CaMBD forms an elongated dimer with a CaM molecule bound at each end; each CaM wraps around three alpha -helices, two from one CaMBD subunit and one from the other. As only the CaM N-lobe has bound Ca2+, the structure provides a view of both calcium-dependent and -independent CaM/protein interactions. Together with biochemical data, the structure suggests a possible gating mechanism for the SK channel.
