The Mg-chelatase H subunit is an abscisic acid receptor
Abscisic acid (ABA) is a vital phytohormone that regulates mainly stomatal aperture and seed development, but ABA receptors involved in these processes have yet to be determined. We previously identified from broad bean an ABA-binding protein (ABAR) potentially involved in stomatal signalling, the gene for which encodes the H subunit of Mg-chelatase (CHLH), which is a key component in both chlorophyll biosynthesis and plastid-to-nucleus signalling. Here we show that Arabidopsis ABAR/CHLH specifically binds ABA, and mediates ABA signalling as a positive regulator in seed germination, post-germination growth and stomatal movement, showing that ABAR/CHLH is an ABA receptor. We show also that ABAR/CHLH is a ubiquitous protein expressed in both green and non-green tissues, indicating that it might be able to perceive the ABA signal at the whole-plant level.
