Catalytic functionalization of unactivated primary C-H bonds directed by an alcohol
New synthetic methods for the catalytic functionalization of C-H bonds have the potential to revolutionize the synthesis of complex molecules(1-4). However, the realization of this synthetic potential requires the ability to functionalize selectively one C-H bond in a compound containing many such bonds and an array of functional groups. The site-selective functionalization of aliphatic C-H bonds is one of the greatest challenges that must be met for C-H bond functionalization to be used widely in complex-molecule synthesis(1,3,5,6), and processes catalysed by transition-metals provide the opportunity to control selectivity(7,8). Current methods for catalytic, aliphatic C-H bond functionalization typically rely on the presence of one inherently reactive C-H bond(9,10), or on installation and subsequent removal of directing groups that are not components of the desired molecule(8). To overcome these limitations, we sought catalysts and reagents that would facilitate aliphatic C-H bond functionalization at a single site, with chemoselectivity derived from the properties of the catalyst and site-selectivity directed by common functional groups(11) contained in both the reactant and the desired product. Here we show that the combination of an iridium-phenanthroline catalyst and a dihydridosilane reagent leads to the site-selective gamma-functionalization of primary C-H bonds controlled by a hydroxyl group, the most common functional group in natural products(12). The scope of the reaction encompasses alcohols and ketones bearing many substitution patterns and auxiliary functional groups; this broad scope suggests that this methodology will be suitable for the site-selective and diastereoselective functionalization of complex natural products.
