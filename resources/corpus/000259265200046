Autophagy in thymic epithelium shapes the T-cell repertoire and is essential for tolerance
Recognition of self- antigen- derived epitopes presented by major histocompatibility complex class II ( MHC II) molecules on thymic epithelial cells ( TECs) is critical for the generation of a functional and self- tolerant CD4 T- cell repertoire. Whereas haematopoietic antigen- presenting cells generate MHC- II - peptide complexes predominantly through the processing of endocytosed polypeptides(1), it remains unknown if and how TECs use unconventional pathways of antigen presentation. Here we address the role of macroautophagy, a process that has recently been shown to allow for endogenous MHC II loading(2-6), in T- cell repertoire selection in the mouse thymus. In contrast to most other tissues, TECs had a high constitutive level of autophagy. Genetic interference with autophagy specifically in TECs led to altered selection of certain MHC-II-restricted T- cell specificities and resulted in severe colitis and multi- organ inflammation. Our findings indicate that autophagy focuses the MHC- II - peptide repertoire of TECs on their intracellular milieu, which notably comprises a wide array of otherwise strictly 'tissue-specific' self antigens(7,8). In doing so, it contributes to T- cell selection and is essential for the generation of a self- tolerant T- cell repertoire.
