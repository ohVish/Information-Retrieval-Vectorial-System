Many-particle entanglement with Bose-Einstein condensates
The possibility of creating and manipulating entangled states of systems of many particles is of significant interest for quantum information processing; such a capability could lead to new applications that rely on the basic principles of quantum mechanics(1). So far, up to four atoms have been entangled in a controlled way(2,3). A crucial requirement for the production of entangled states is that they can be considered pure at the single-particle level. Bose-Einstein condensates(4-6) fulfil this requirement; hence it is natural to investigate whether they can also be used in some applications of quantum information. Here we propose a method to achieve substantial entanglement of a large number of atoms in a Bose-Einstein condensate. A single resonant laser pulse is applied to all the atoms in the condensate, which is then allowed to evolve freely; in this latter stage, collisional interactions produce entanglement between the atoms. The technique should be realizable with present technology.
