A role for the phagosome in cytokine secretion
Membrane traffic in activated macrophages is required for two critical events in innate immunity: proinflammatory cytokine secretion and phagocytosis of pathogens. We found a joint trafficking pathway linking both actions, which may economize membrane transport and augment the immune response. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) is trafficked from the Golgi to the recycling endosome (RE), where vesicle-associated membrane protein 3 mediates its delivery to the cell surface at the site of phagocytic cup formation. Fusion of the RE at the cup simultaneously allows rapid release of TNF alpha and expands the membrane for phagocytosis.
