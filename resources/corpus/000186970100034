Insulin signaling in health and disease
The signaling pathways used by insulin have been identified [M. White, Insulin Signaling Pathway, Sci. STKE (Connections Map, as seen November 2003), http://stke.sciencemag. org/cgi/cm/cmp_12069]. Now our challenge is to understand how the failure of these signals is associated with obesity and the progressive failure of pancreatic beta cells that leads to diabetes. Whether better management of chronic inflammation can improve insulin action is an important area of investigation. Drugs that stimulate IRS2 (insulin receptor substrate protein 2) synthesis or signaling might be a good starting point. This knowledge will lead to rational strategies that prevent or cure diabetes.
