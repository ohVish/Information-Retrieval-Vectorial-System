Treatment of murine colitis by Lactococcus lactis secreting interleukin-10
The cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) has shown promise in clinical trials for treatment of inflammatory bower disease (IBD), Using two mouse models, we show that the therapeutic dose of IL-10 can be reduced by Localized delivery of a bacterium genetically engineered to secrete the cytokine, Intragastric administration of IL-10-secreting Lactococcus lactis caused a 50% reduction in colitis in mice treated with dextran sulfate sodium and prevented the onset of colitis in IL-10(-/-) mice. This approach may Lead to better methods for cost-effective and Long-term management of IBD in humans.
