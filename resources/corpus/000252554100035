Catalytic C-H functionalization by metal carbenoid and nitrenoid insertion
Novel reactions that can selectively functionalize carbon - hydrogen bonds are of intense interest to the chemical community because they offer new strategic approaches for synthesis. A very promising 'carbon - hydrogen functionalization' method involves the insertion of metal carbenes and nitrenes into C - H bonds. This area has experienced considerable growth in the past decade, particularly in the area of enantioselective intermolecular reactions. Here we discuss several facets of these kinds of C - H functionalization reactions and provide a perspective on how this methodology has affected the synthesis of complex natural products and potential pharmaceutical agents.
