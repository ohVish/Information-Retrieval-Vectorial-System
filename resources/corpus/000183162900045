Modulation of oestrogen receptor signalling by association with the activated dioxin receptor
Environmental contaminants affect a wide variety of biological events in many species. Dioxins are typical environmental contaminants that exert adverse oestrogen-related effects(1). Although their anti-oestrogenic actions(2,3) are well described, dioxins can also induce endometriosis(4-7) and oestrogen-dependent tumours(8,9), implying possible oestrogenic effects. However, the molecular mechanism underlying oestrogen-related actions of dioxins remains largely unknown. A heterodimer of the dioxin receptor (AhR) and Arnt, which are basic helix-loop-helix/PAS-family transcription factors, mediates most of the toxic effects of dioxins(10,11). Here we show that the agonist-activated AhR/Arnt heterodimer directly associates with oestrogen receptors ER-alpha and ER-beta. This association results in the recruitment of unliganded ER and the co-activator p300 to oestrogen-responsive gene promoters, leading to activation of transcription and oestrogenic effects. The function of liganded ER is attenuated. Oestrogenic actions of AhR agonists were detected in wild-type ovariectomized mouse uteri, but were absent in AhR(-/-) or ER-alpha(-/-) ovariectomized mice. Our findings suggest a novel mechanism by which ER-mediated oestrogen signalling is modulated by a co-regulatory-like function of activated AhR/Arnt, giving rise to adverse oestrogen-related actions of dioxin-type environmental contaminants.
