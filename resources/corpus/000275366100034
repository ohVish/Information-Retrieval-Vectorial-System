Electron liquids and solids in one dimension
Even though bulk metallic systems contain a very large number of strongly interacting electrons, their properties are well described within Landau's Fermi liquid theory of non-interacting quasiparticles. Although many higher-dimensional systems can be successfully understood on the basis of such non-interacting theories, this is not possible for one-dimensional systems. When confined to narrow channels, electron interaction gives rise to such exotic phenomena as spin-charge separation and the emergence of correlated-electron insulators. Such strongly correlated electronic behaviour has recently been seen in experiments on one-dimensional carbon nanotubes and nanowires, and this behaviour challenges the theoretical description of such systems.
