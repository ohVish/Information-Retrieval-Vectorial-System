Changes in deep-water formation during the Younger Dryas event inferred from Be-10 and C-14 records
Variations in atmospheric radiocarbon (C-14) concentrations can be attributed either to changes in the carbon cycle(1)-through the rate of radiocarbon removal from the atmosphere-or to variations in the production rate of C-14 due to changes in solar activity or the Earth's magnetic field(2). The production rates of Be-10 and C-14 vary in the same way, but whereas atmospheric radiocarbon concentrations are additionally affected by the carbon cycle, Be-10 concentrations reflect production rates more directly. A record of the Be-10 production-rate variations can therefore be used to separate the two influences-production rates and the carbon cycle-on radiocarbon concentrations. Here we present such an analysis of the large fluctuations in atmospheric C-14 concentrations, of unclear origin(3), that occurred during the Younger Dryas cold period(6). We use the Be-10 record from the GISP2 ice core(5) to model past production rates of radionuclides, and rnd that the largest part of the fluctuations in atmospheric radiocarbon concentrations can be attributed to variations in production rate. The residual difference between measured C-14 concentrations and those modelled using the Be-10 record can be explained with an additional change in the carbon cycle, most probably in the amount of deep-water formation.
