Rapid formation of sulfuric acid particles at near-atmospheric conditions
We investigated the formation of new particles in a laboratory study, starting from H2SO4 produced in situ through the reaction of OH radicals with SO.. Newly formed particles were observed for H2SO4 concentrations above 7 x 106 per cubic centimeter. At 293 kelvin, a rough estimate yielded a nucleation rate of 0.3 to 0.4 particles per cubic centimeter per second for similar to10(7) particles per cubic centimeter of H2SO4 (particle size greater than or equal to 3 nanometers). These findings are in agreement with observations from the atmosphere. The results demonstrate that under laboratory conditions similar to the atmosphere, particle formation occurs at atmospheric H2SO4 concentration levels.
