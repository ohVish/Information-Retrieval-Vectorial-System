Corpse clearance defines the meaning of cell death
While philosophers seek the meaning of life, cell biologists are becoming ever more interested in the meaning of death. Apoptosis marks unwanted cells with 'eat me' signals that direct recognition, engulfment and degradation by phagocytes. Far from being the end of the story, these clearance events allow scavenger cells to confer meaning upon cell death. But if the phagocytic 'spin doctors' receive or transmit the wrong messages, trouble ensues.
