Dating of pore waters with I-129: Relevance for the origin of marine gas hydrates
Pore waters associated with gas hydrates at Blake Ridge in the Atlantic Ocean were dated by measuring their iodine-129/iodine-129/iodine ratios. Samples collected from sediments with ages between 1.8 and 6 million years ago consistently yield ages around 55 million years ago. These ages, together with the strong iodine enrichment observed in the pore waters, suggest that the origin of iodine is related to organic material of early Tertiary age, which probably is also the source of the methane in the gas hydrates at this location.
