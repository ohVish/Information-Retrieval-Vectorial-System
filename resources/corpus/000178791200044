The developing synapse: Construction and modulation of synaptic structures and circuits
Synapse formation and stabilization in the vertebrate central nervous system is a dynamic process, requiring bi-directional communication between pre- and postsynaptic partners. Numerous mechanisms coordinate where and when synapses are made in the developing brain. This review discusses cellular and activity-dependent mechanisms that control the development of synaptic connectivity.
