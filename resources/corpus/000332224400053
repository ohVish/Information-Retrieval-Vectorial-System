Sulphoglycolysis in Escherichia coli K-12 closes a gap in the biogeochemical sulphur cycle
Sulphoquinovose (SQ, 6-deoxy-6-sulphoglucose) has been known for 50 years as the polar headgroup of the plant sulpholipid(1,2) in the photosynthetic membranes of all higher plants, mosses, ferns, algae and most photosynthetic bacteria(3). It is also found in some non-photosynthetic bacteria(4), and SQ is part of the surface layer of some Archaea(5). The estimated annual production of SQ(4) is 10,000,000,000 tonnes (10 petagrams), thus it comprises a major portion of the organo-sulphur in nature, where SQ is degraded by bacteria(6,7). However, despite evidence for at least three different degradative pathways in bacteria(6-8), no enzymic reaction or gene in any pathway has been defined, although a sulphoglycolytic pathway has been proposed(7). Here we show that Escherichia coli K-12, the most widely studied prokaryotic model organism, performs sulphoglycolysis, in addition to standard glycolysis. SQ is catabolised through four newly discovered reactions that we established using purified, heterologously expressed enzymes: SQ isomerase, 6-deoxy-6-sulphofructose (SF) kinase, 6-deoxy-6-sulphofructose-1-phosphate (SFP) aldolase, and 3-sulpholactaldehyde (SLA) reductase. The enzymes are encoded in a ten-gene cluster, which probably also encodes regulation, transport and degradation of the whole sulpholipid; the gene cluster is present in almost all (>91%) available E. coli genomes, and is wide-spread in Enterobacteriaceae. The pathway yields dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), which powers energy conservation and growth of E. coli, and the sulphonate product 2,3-dihydroxypropane-1-sulphonate (DHPS), which is excreted. DHPS is mineralized by other bacteria, thus closing the sulphur cycle within a bacterial community.
