Golgi duplication in Trypanosoma brucei requires Centrin2
Centrins are highly conserved components of the centrosome, which in the parasitic protozoan T. brucei comprises the basal body and nucleates the flagellum used for locomotion. Here, we found TbCentrin2 in an additional bi-lobed structure near to the Golgi apparatus. One lobe was associated with the old Golgi, and the other became associated with the newly forming Golgi as the cell grew.. Depletion of TbCentrin1 inhibited duplication of the basal body, whereas depletion of TbCentrin2 also inhibited duplication of the Golgi. Thus, a Centrin2-containing structure distinct from the basal body appears to mark the site for new Golgi assembly.
