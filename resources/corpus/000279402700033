Experimental Results for H-2 Formation from H- and H and Implications for First Star Formation
During the epoch of first star formation, molecular hydrogen (H-2) generated via associative detachment (AD) of H- and H is believed to have been the main coolant of primordial gas for temperatures below 10(4) kelvin. The uncertainty in the cross section for this reaction has limited our understanding of protogalaxy formation during this epoch and of the characteristic masses and cooling times for the first stars. We report precise energy-resolved measurements of the AD reaction, made with the use of a specially constructed merged-beams apparatus. Our results agreed well with the most recent theoretically calculated cross section, which we then used in cosmological simulations to demonstrate how the reduced AD uncertainty improves constraints of the predicted masses for Population III stars.
