Observation of the two-channel Kondo effect
Some of the most intriguing problems in solid-state physics arise when the motion of one electron dramatically affects the motion of surrounding electrons. Traditionally, such highly correlated electron systems have been studied mainly in materials with complex transition metal chemistry(1,2). Over the past decade, researchers have learned to confine one or a few electrons within a nanometre-scale semiconductor 'artificial atom', and to understand and control this simple system in detail(3). Here we combine artificial atoms to create a highly correlated electron system within a nano-engineered semiconductor structure(4). We tune the system in situ through a quantum phase transition between two distinct states, each a version of the Kondo state(5), in which a bound electron interacts with surrounding mobile electrons. The boundary between these competing Kondo states is a quantum critical point - namely, the exotic and previously elusive two-channel Kondo state(6,7), in which electrons in two reservoirs are entangled through their interaction with a single localized spin.
