Structure of the ABC transporter MsbA in complex with ADP-vanadate and lipopolysaccharide
Select members of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family couple ATP binding and hydrolysis to substrate efflux and confer multidrug resistance. We have determined the x-ray structure of MsbA in complex with magnesium, adenosine diphosphate, and inorganic vanadate (Mg-ADP-V-i) and the rough-chemotype lipopolysaccharide, Ra LPS. The structure supports a model involving a rigid-body torque of the two transmembrane domains during ATP hydrolysis and suggests a mechanism by which the nucleotide-binding domain communicates with the transmembrane domain. We propose a lipid "flip-flop" mechanism in which the sugar groups are sequestered in the chamber while the hydrophobic tails are dragged through the lipid bilayer.
