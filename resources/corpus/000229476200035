Paths to understanding the genetic basis of autoimmune disease
Some people inherit an unfortunate combination of genetic sequences, such that exposure to an external trigger causes their immune response to turn on their own tissues. Although mutations in a single gene can cause autoimmunity, most autoimmune diseases are associated with several sequence variants. Marked advances in genetic resources and tools are now making it possible to identify the sequence variants that contribute to autoimmune diseases - promising a better understanding of how we normally remain tolerant of our own tissue components, and how this goes wrong in autoimmune disease.
