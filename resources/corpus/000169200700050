In silico mapping of complex disease-related traits in mice
Experimental murine genetic models of complex human disease show great potential for understanding human disease pathogenesis. To reduce the time required for analysis of such models from many months down to milliseconds, a computational method for predicting chromosomal regions regulating phenotypic traits and a murine database of single nucleotide polymorphisms were developed. After entry of phenotypic information obtained from inbred mouse strains, the phenotypic and genotypic information is analyzed in silico to predict the chromosomal regions regulating the phenotypic trait.
