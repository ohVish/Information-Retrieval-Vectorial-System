Haematopoietic stem cells depend on G alpha(s)-mediated signalling to engraft bone marrow
Haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) change location during development(1) and circulate in mammals throughout life(2), moving into and out of the bloodstream to engage bone marrow niches in sequential steps of homing, engraftment and retention(3-5). Here we show that HSPC engraftment of bone marrow in fetal development is dependent on the guanine-nucleotide-binding protein stimulatory a subunit (G alpha(s)). HSPCs from adult mice deficient in G alpha(s) (G alpha(-/-)(s)) differentiate and undergo chemotaxis, but also do not home to or engraft in the bone marrow in adult mice and demonstrate a marked inability to engage the marrow microvasculature. If deleted after engraftment, G alpha(s) deficiency did not lead to lack of retention in the marrow, rather cytokine-induced mobilization into the blood was impaired. Testing whether activation of G alpha(s) affects HSPCs, pharmacological activators enhanced homing and engraftment in vivo. G alpha(s) governs specific aspects of HSPC localization under physiological conditions in vivo and may be pharmacologically targeted to improve transplantation efficiency.
