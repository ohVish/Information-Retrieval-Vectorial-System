Structure of the reovirus core at 3.6 angstrom resolution
The reovirus core is an assembly with a relative molecular mass of 52 million that synthesizes, modifies and exports viral messenger RNA. Analysis of its structure by X-ray crystallography shows that there are alternative, specific and completely nonequivalent contacts made by several surfaces of two of its proteins; that the RNA capping and export apparatus is a hollow cylinder, which probably sequesters its substrate to ensure completion of the capping reactions; that the genomic double-stranded RNA is coiled into concentric layers within the particle; and that there is a protein shell that appears to be common to all groups of double-stranded RNA viruses.
