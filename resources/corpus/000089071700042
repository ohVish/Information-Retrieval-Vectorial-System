A quantum state-resolved insertion reaction: O(D-1)+H-2(J=O) -> OH((2)Pi, v, N)+H(S-2)
The O(D-1) + H-2 --> OH + H reaction, which proceeds mainly as an insertion reaction at a collisional energy of 1.3 kilocalories per mole, has been investigated with the high-resolution H atom Rydberg "tagging" time-of-flight technique and the quasiclassical trajectory (QCT) method. Quantum state-resolved differential cross sections were measured for this prototype reaction. Different rotationally-vibrationally excited OH products have markedly different angular distributions, whereas the total reaction products are roughly forward and backward symmetric. Theoretical results obtained from QCT calculations indicate that this reaction is dominated by the insertion mechanism, with a small contribution from the collinear abstraction mechanism through quantum tunneling.
