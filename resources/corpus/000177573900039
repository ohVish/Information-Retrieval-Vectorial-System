The vibration-rotation emission spectrum of free BeH2
The gaseous BeH2 molecule has been synthesized by means of an electrical discharge inside a high-temperature furnace and identified with infrared emission spectroscopy. The antisymmetric stretching mode nu(3) has been detected near 2179 reciprocal centimeters. The BeH2 molecule has a linear, symmetric structure with an r(o) BeH bond length of 1.333761(2) angstroms.
