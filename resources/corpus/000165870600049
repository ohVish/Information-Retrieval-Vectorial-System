Molybdenum nanowires by electrodeposition
Metallic molybdenum (Mo-o) wires with diameters ranging from 15 nanometers to 1.0 micrometers and Lengths of up to 500 micrometers (0.5 millimeters) were prepared in a two-step procedure. Molybdenum oxide wires were electrodeposited selectively at step edges and then reduced in hydrogen gas at 500 degreesC to yield Mo-o. The hemicylindrical wires prepared by this technique were self-uniform, and the wires prepared in a particular electrodeposition tin batches of 10(5) to 10(7)) were narrowly distributed in diameter. Wires were obtained size selectively because the mean wire diameter was directly proportional to the square root of the electrolysis time. The metal nanowires could be embedded in a polystyrene film and lifted off the graphite electrode surface. The conductivity and mechanical resiliency of individual embedded wires were similar to those of bulk molybdenum.
