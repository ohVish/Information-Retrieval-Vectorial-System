Asymmetric and symmetric stem-cell divisions in development and cancer
Much has been made of the idea that asymmetric cell division is a defining characteristic of stem cells that enables them to simultaneously perpetuate themselves (self-renew) and generate differentiated progeny. Yet many stem cells can divide symmetrically, particularly when they are expanding in number during development or after injury. Thus, asymmetric division is not necessary for stem-cell identity but rather is a tool that stem cells can use to maintain appropriate numbers of progeny. The facultative use of symmetric or asymmetric divisions by stem cells may be a key adaptation that is crucial for adult regenerative capacity.
