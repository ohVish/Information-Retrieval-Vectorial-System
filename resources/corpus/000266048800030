Achieving lambda/20 Resolution by One-Color Initiation and Deactivation of Polymerization
In conventional photolithography, diffraction limits the resolution to about one-quarter of the wavelength of the light used. We introduce an approach to photolithography in which multiphoton absorption of pulsed 800-nanometer (nm) light is used to initiate cross-linking in a polymer photoresist and one-photon absorption of continuous-wave 800-nm light is used simultaneously to deactivate the photopolymerization. By employing spatial phase-shaping of the deactivation beam, we demonstrate the fabrication of features with scalable resolution along the beam axis, down to a 40-nm minimum feature size. We anticipate application of this technique for the fabrication of diverse two- and three-dimensional structures with a feature size that is a small fraction of the wavelength of the light employed.
