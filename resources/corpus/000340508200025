Ribosomal frameshifting in the CCR5 mRNA is regulated by miRNAs and the NMD pathway
Programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift (-1 PRF) signals redirect translating ribosomes to slip back one base on messenger RNAs. Although well characterizedin viruses, how these elements may regulate cellular gene expression is not understood. Here we describe a -1 PRF signal in the human mRNA encoding CCR5, the HIV-1 co-receptor. CCR5 mRNA-mediated -1 PRF is directed by an mRNA pseudoknot, and is stimulated by at least two microRNAs. Mapping the mRNA-miRNA interaction suggests that formation of a triplex RNA structure stimulates -1 PRF. A -1 PRF event on the CCR5 mRNA directs translating ribosomes to a premature termination codon, destabilizing it through the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway. At least one additional mRNA decay pathway is also involved. Functional -1 PRF signals that seem to be regulated by miRNAs are also demonstrated in mRNAs encoding six other cytokine receptors, suggesting a novel mode through which immune responses may be fine-tuned in mammalian cells.
