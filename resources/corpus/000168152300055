Gulliver's travels in HIVland
The emergence of HIV and AIDS is narrated here through the eyes of the legendary Irish traveller Gulliver, observing the replication, cross-species origin, evolution, diversity and transmission of HIV. Ethical problems of vaccine trials, the social impact of AIDS, and prospects for its prevention, including the development of topical virucidal lotions, are discussed. The existence of a growing proportion of HIV-infected, immunocompromised children and adults may significantly affect current immunization programmes and the evolution of opportunistic infections.
