Subcellular mRNA Localization in Animal Cells and Why It Matters
Subcellular localization of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) can give precise control over where protein products are synthesized and operate. However, just 10 years ago many in the broader cell biology community would have considered this a specialized mechanism restricted to a very small fraction of transcripts. Since then, it has become clear that subcellular targeting of mRNAs is prevalent, and there is mounting evidence for central roles for this process in many cellular events. Here, we review current knowledge of the mechanisms and functions of mRNA localization in animal cells.
