Structural evidence for evolution of the beta/alpha barrel scaffold by gene duplication and fusion
The atomic structures of two proteins in the histidine biosynthesis pathway consist of beta/alpha barrels with a twofold repeat pattern. It is Likely that these proteins evolved by twofold gene duplication and gene fusion from a common half-barrel ancestor. These ancestral domains are not visible as independent domains in the extant proteins but can be inferred from a combination of sequence and structural analysis. The detection of subdomain structures may be useful in efforts to search genome sequences for functionally and structurally related proteins.
