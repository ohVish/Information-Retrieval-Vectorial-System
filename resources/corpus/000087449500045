Dynamics of the silicon (111) surface phase transition
The manner in which phase transformations occur in solids determines important structural and physical properties of many materials. The main problem in characterizing the kinetic processes that occur during phase transformations is the difficulty of observing directly, in real time, the growth of one phase at the expense of another. Here we use low-energy electron microscopy to study the real-time kinetics of a phase transformation confined to the silicon (111) surface. We show that the transformation is governed by the rate at which material is exchanged between the first layer of the crystal and the surface. In bulk phase transformations. the dynamics are usually governed either by the rate of diffusion of material to the phase boundaries or by the structural rearrangement of atoms at the phase boundary(1). The kinetic process that we have identified here has no bulk analogue and leads to domain dynamics that are qualitatively different from these expected for bulk systems.
