Coseismic and postseismic fault slip for the 17 August 1999, M=7.5, Izmit, Turkey earthquake
We use Global Positioning System (GPS) observations and elastic half-space models to estimate the distribution of coseismic and postseismic slip along the Izmit earthquake rupture. Our results indicate that Large coseismic slip (reaching 5.7 meters) is confined to the upper 10 kilometers of the crust, correlates with structurally distinct fault segments, and is relatively Low near the hypocenter, Continued surface deformation during the first 75 days after the earthquake indicates an aseismic fault slip of as much as 0.43 meters on and below the coseismic rupture. These observations are consistent with a transition from unstable (episodic Large earthquakes) to stable (fault creep) sliding at the base of the seismogenic zone.
