Amyloid fibrils of the HET-s(218-289) prion form a beta solenoid with a triangular hydrophobic core
Prion and nonprion forms of proteins are believed to differ solely in their three- dimensional structure, which is therefore of paramount importance for the prion function. However, no atomic-resolution structure of the fibrillar state that is likely infectious has been reported to date. We present a structural model based on solid- state nuclear magnetic resonance restraints for amyloid fibrils from the prion- forming domain ( residues 218 to 289) of the HET- s protein from the filamentous fungus Podospora anserina. On the basis of 134 intra- and intermolecular experimental distance restraints, we find that HET- s( 218 - 289) forms a left- handed beta solenoid, with each molecule forming two helical windings, a compact hydrophobic core, at least 23 hydrogen bonds, three salt bridges, and two asparagine ladders. The structure is likely to have broad implications for understanding the infectious amyloid state.
