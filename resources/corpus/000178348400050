Sequence of Plasmodium falciparum chromosome 12
The human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum is responsible for the death of more than a million people every year(1). To stimulate basic research on the disease, and to promote the development of effective drugs and vaccines against the parasite, the complete genome of P. falciparum clone 3D7 has been sequenced, using a chromosome-by-chromosome shotgun strategy(2-4). Here we report the nucleotide sequence of the third largest of the parasite's 14 chromosomes, chromosome 12, which comprises about 10% of the 23-megabase genome. As the most (A + T)-rich (80.6%) genome sequenced to date, the P. falciparum genome presented severe problems during the assembly of primary sequence reads. We discuss the methodology that yielded a finished and fully contiguous sequence for chromosome 12. The biological implications of the sequence data are more thoroughly discussed in an accompanying Article (ref. 3).
