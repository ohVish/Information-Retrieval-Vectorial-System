Repeated injections of energy in the first 600ms of the giant flare of SGR 1806-20
The massive flare of 27 December 2004 from the soft gamma-ray repeater SGR 1806-20, a possible magnetar(1-3), saturated almost all gamma-ray detectors(4-7), meaning that the profile of the pulse was poorly characterized. An accurate profile is essential to determine physically what was happening at the source. Here we report the unsaturated gamma-ray profile for the first 600 ms of the flare, with a time resolution of 5.48 ms. The peak of the profile (of the order of 10(7) photons cm(-2) s(-1)) was reached similar to 50 ms after the onset of the flare, and was then followed by a gradual decrease with superposed oscillatory modulations possibly representing repeated energy injections with similar to 60-ms intervals. The implied total energy is comparable to the stored magnetic energy in a magnetar (similar to 10(47) erg) based on the dipole magnetic field intensity (similar to 10(15) G), suggesting either that the energy release mechanism was extremely efficient or that the interior magnetic field is much stronger than the external dipole field(2).
