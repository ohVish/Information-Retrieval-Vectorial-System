Homogenization of fish faunas across the United States
Fish faunas across the continental United States have become more similar through time because of widespread introductions of a group of cosmopolitan species intended to enhance food and sport fisheries. On average, pairs of states have 15.4 more species in common now than before European settlement of North America. The 89 pairs of states that formerly had no species in common now share an average of 25.2 species. Introductions have played a Larger role than extirpations in homogenizing fish faunas. Western and New England states have received the most introductions, which is a reflection of the small number of native fishes in these areas considered desirable gamefish by settlers.
