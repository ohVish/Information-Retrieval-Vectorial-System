Modulation of cell adhesion and motility in the immune system by Myo1f
Although class I myosins are known to play a wide range of roles, the physiological function of long-tailed class I myosins in vertebrates remains elusive. We demonstrated that one of these proteins, Myo1f, is expressed predominantly in the mammalian immune system. Cells from Myo1f-deficient mice exhibited abnormally increased adhesion and reduced motility, resulting from augmented exocytosis of beta 2 integrin - containing granules. Also, the cortical actin that co-localizes with Myo1f was reduced in Myo1f-deficient cells. In vivo, Myo1f-deficient mice showed increased susceptibility to infection by Listeria monocytogenes and an impaired neutrophil response. Thus, Myo1f directs immune cell motility and innate host defense against infection.
