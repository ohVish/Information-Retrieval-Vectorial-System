Dissociation of MgSiO(3) in the cores of gas giants and terrestrial exoplanets
CalrO(3)-type MgSiO(3) is the planet-forming silicate stable at pressures and temperatures beyond those of Earth's core-mantle boundary. First-principles quasiharmonic free-energy computations show that this mineral should dissociate into CsCl-type MgO+cotunnite-type SiO(2) at pressures and temperatures expected to occur in the cores of the gas giants and in terrestrial exoplanets. At similar to 10 megabars and similar to 10,000 kelvin, cotunnite-type SiO(2) should have thermally activated electron carriers and thus electrical conductivity close to metallic values. Electrons wilt give a large contribution to thermal conductivity, and electronic damping will suppress radiative heat transport.
