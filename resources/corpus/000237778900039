Mechanisms of drug inhibition of signalling molecules
The emergence of tumour-specific, molecularly targeted agents signifies a paradigm shift in cancer therapy, with less reliance on drugs that non-discriminately kill tumour and host cells. Although the diversity of targets giving rise to this new generation of anticancer drugs has expanded, many challenges persist in the design of effective treatment regimens. The complex interplay of signal-transduction pathways further complicates the customization of cancer treatments to target single mechanisms. However, despite uncertainty over precise or dominant mechanisms of action, especially for compounds targeting multiple gene products, emerging agents are producing significant therapeutic advances against a broad range of human cancers.
