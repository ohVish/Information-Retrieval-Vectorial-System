Location, location, location: Membrane targeting directed by PX domains
Phosphoinositide (PI)-binding domains play critical roles in the intracellular localization of a variety of cell-signaling proteins. The 120-amino acid Phox homology (PX) domain targets proteins to organelle membranes through interactions between two conserved basic motifs within the PX domain and specific PIS. The combination of protein-lipid and protein-protein interactions ensures the proper Localization and regulation of PX domain-containing proteins. Upon proper Localization, PX domain-containing proteins can then bind to additional proteins and execute their functions in a diverse set of biological pathways, including intracellular protein transport, cell growth and survival, cytoskeletal organization, and neutrophil defense.
