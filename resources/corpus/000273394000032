Iron Partitioning and Density Changes of Pyrolite in Earth's Lower Mantle
Phase transitions and the chemical composition of minerals in Earth's interior influence geophysical interpretations of its deep structure and dynamics. A pressure-induced spin transition in olivine has been suggested to influence iron partitioning and depletion, resulting in a distinct layered structure in Earth's lower mantle. For a more realistic mantle composition (pyrolite), we observed a considerable change in the iron-magnesium partition coefficient at about 40 gigapascals that is explained by a spin transition at much lower pressures. However, only a small depletion of iron is observed in the major high-pressure phase (magnesium silicate perovskite), which may be explained by preferential retention of the iron ion Fe3+. Changes in mineral proportions or density are not associated with the change in partition coefficient. The observed density profile agrees well with seismological models, which suggests that pyrolite is a good model composition for the upper to middle parts of the lower mantle.
