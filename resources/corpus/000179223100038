Coherence with atoms
The past decade has seen dramatic progress in our ability to manipulate and coherently control the motion of atoms. This progress has both fundamental and applied importance. On the one hand, recent experiments are providing new perspectives for the study of quantum phase transitions and highly entangled quantum states. On the other hand, this exquisite control offers the prospect of a new generation of force sensors of unprecedented sensitivity and accuracy.
