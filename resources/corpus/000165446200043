Modulated chemical doping of individual carbon nanotubes
Modulation doping of a semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotube along its length leads to an intramolecular wire electronic device. The nanotube is doped n-type for half of Its length and p-type for the other half. Electrostatic gating can tune the system into p-n junctions, causing it to exhibit rectifying characteristics or negative differential conductance. The system can also be tuned into n-type, exhibiting single-electron charging and negative differential conductance at low temperatures. The low-temperature behavior is manifested by a quantum dot formed by chemical inhomogeneity along the tube.
