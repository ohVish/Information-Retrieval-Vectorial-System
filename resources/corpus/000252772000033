Single-molecule cut-and-paste surface assembly
We introduce a method for the bottom- up assembly of biomolecular structures that combines the precision of the atomic force microscope ( AFM) with the selectivity of DNA hybridization. Functional units coupled to DNA oligomers were picked up from a depot area by means of a complementary DNA strand bound to an AFM tip. These units were transferred to and deposited on a target area to create basic geometrical structures, assembled from units with different functions. Each of these cut- and- paste events was characterized by single- molecule force spectroscopy and single- molecule fluorescence microscopy. Transport and deposition of more than 5000 units were achieved, with less than 10% loss in transfer efficiency.
