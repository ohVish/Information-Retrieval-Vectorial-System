A stable silicon(0) compound with a Si=Si double bond
Dative, or nonoxidative, ligand coordination is common in transition metal complexes; however, this bonding motif is rare in compounds of main group elements in the formal oxidation state of zero. Here, we report that the potassium graphite reduction of the neutral hypervalent silicon- carbene complex L:SiCl4 {where L: is : C[N(2,6-Pr-2(i)-C6H3)CH](2) and Pr-i is isopropyl} produces L:(Cl)Si-Si(Cl):L, a carbene- stabilized bis- silylene, and L:Si= Si:L, a carbene- stabilized diatomic silicon molecule with the Si atoms in the formal oxidation state of zero. The Si-Si bond distance of 2.2294 +/- 0.0011 ( standard deviation) angstroms in L:Si= Si:L is consistent with a Si=Si double bond. Complementary computational studies confirm the nature of the bonding in L:(Cl)Si-Si(Cl):L and L:Si=Si:L.
