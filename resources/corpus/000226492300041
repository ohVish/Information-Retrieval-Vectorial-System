Creating order from random fluctuations in small spin ensembles
We demonstrate the ability to create spin order by using a magnetic resonance force microscope to harness the naturally occurring statistical fluctuations in small ensembles of electron spins. In one method, we hyperpolarized the spin system by selectively capturing the transient spin order created by the statistical fluctuations. In a second method, we took a more active approach and rectified the spin fluctuations by applying real-time feedback to the entire spin ensemble. The created spin order can be stored in the laboratory frame for a period on the order of the longitudinal relaxation time of 30 seconds and then read out.
