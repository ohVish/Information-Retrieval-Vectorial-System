Reelin promotes peripheral synapse elimination and maturation (Retracted Article. See vol 303, pg 1974, 2004)
Reelin is an extracellular protein that is crucial for layer formation in the embryonic brain. Here, we demonstrate that Reelin functions postnatally to regulate the development of the neuromuscular junction. Reelin is required for motor end-plate maturation and proper nerve-muscle connectivity, and it directly promotes synapse elimination. Unlike layer formation, neuromuscular junction development requires a function of Reelin that is not mediated by Disabled1 or very-low-density lipoprotein receptors and apolipoprotein E receptor 2 receptors but by a distinct mechanism involving its protease activity.
