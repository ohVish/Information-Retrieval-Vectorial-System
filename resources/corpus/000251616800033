Mott transition in VO2 revealed by infrared spectroscopy and nano-imaging
Electrons in correlated insulators are prevented from conducting by Coulomb repulsion between them. When an insulator- to- metal transition is induced in a correlated insulator by doping or heating, the resulting conducting state can be radically different from that characterized by free electrons in conventional metals. We report on the electronic properties of a prototypical correlated insulator vanadium dioxide in which the metallic state can be induced by increasing temperature. Scanning near- field infrared microscopy allows us to directly image nanoscale metallic puddles that appear at the onset of the insulator- to- metal transition. In combination with far- field infrared spectroscopy, the data reveal the Mott transition with divergent quasi- particle mass in the metallic puddles. The experimental approach used sets the stage for investigations of charge dynamics on the nanoscale in other inhomogeneous correlated electron systems.
