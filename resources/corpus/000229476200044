A resolved outflow of matter from a brown dwarf
The birth of stars involves not only accretion but also, counterintuitively, the expulsion of matter in the form of highly supersonic outflows(1,2). Although this phenomenon has been seen in young stars, a fundamental question is whether it also occurs among newborn brown dwarfs: these are the so-called 'failed stars', with masses between stars and planets, that never manage to reach temperatures high enough for normal hydrogen fusion to occur(3). Recently, evidence for accretion in young brown dwarfs has mounted(4-6), and their spectra show lines that are suggestive of outflows(7-9). Here we report spectro-astrometric data that spatially resolve an outflow from a brown dwarf. The outflow's characteristics appear similar to, but on a smaller scale than, outflows from normal young stars. This result suggests that the outflow mechanism is universal, and perhaps relevant even to the formation of planets.
