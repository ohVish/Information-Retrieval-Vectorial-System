Mouse brain organization revealed through direct genome-scale TF expression analysis
In the developing brain, transcription factors (TFs) direct the formation of a diverse array of neurons and glia. We identified 1445 putative TFs in the mouse genome. We used in situ hybridization to map the expression of over 1000 of these TFs and TF-coregulator genes in the brains of developing mice. We found that 349 of these genes showed restricted expression patterns that were adequate to describe the anatomical organization of the brain. We provide a comprehensive inventory of murine TFs and their expression patterns in a searchable brain atlas database.
