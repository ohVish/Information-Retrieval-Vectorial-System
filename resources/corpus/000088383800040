Signatures of granular microstructure in dense shear flows
Granular materials and ordinary fluids react differently to shear stresses. Rather than deforming uniformly, materials such as dry sand or cohesionless powders develop shear bands(1-5)-narrow zones of large relative particle motion, with essentially rigid adjacent regions. Because shear bands mark areas of flow, material failure and energy dissipation, they are important in many industrial, civil engineering and geophysical processes(6). They are also relevant to lubricating fluids confined to ultrathin molecular layers(7). However, detailed three-dimensional information on motion within a shear band, including the degree of particle rotation and interparticle slip, is lacking. Similarly, very little is known about how the microstructure of individual grains affects movement in densely packed material(5). Here we combine magnetic resonance imaging, X-ray tomography and high-speed-video particle tracking to obtain the local steady-state particle velocity, rotation and packing density for shear flow in a three-dimensional Couette geometry. We find that key characteristics of the granular microstructure determine the shape of the velocity profile.
