Asynchronous climate changes in the North Atlantic and Japan during the last termination
Pollen records from the annually laminated sediment sequence in Lake Suigetsu, Japan, suggest a sequence of climate changes during the Last Termination that resembles that of the North Atlantic region but with noticeable differences in timing. An interstadial interval commenced a few centuries earlier [similar to15,000 years before the present (yr B.P.)] than the North Atlantic GI-1 (Bolling) event Conversely, the onset of a Younger Dryas (YD)-like cold reversal (112,300 to 11,250 yr B.P.) postdated the North Atlantic GS-1 (YD) event by a few centuries. Climate in the Far East during the Last Termination reflected solar insolation changes as much as Atlantic influences.
