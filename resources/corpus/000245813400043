The maternal-zygotic transition: Death and birth of RNAs
Maternal gene products drive early development when the newly formed embryo is transcriptionally inactive. During the maternal-zygotic transition, embryonic transcription is initiated and many maternal RNAs are degraded. Multiple mechanisms regulate the birth of zygotic RNAs and the death of maternal RNAs. Genome activation appears to rely in part on the sequestration of transcriptional repressors by the exponentially increasing amount of DNA during cleavage divisions. Maternal RNA degradation is induced by the binding of proteins and microRNAs to the 3' untranslated region of target RNAs.
