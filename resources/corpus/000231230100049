In situ stable isotope probing of methanogenic archaea in the rice rhizosphere
Microorganisms living in anoxic rice soils contribute 10 to 25% of global methane emissions. The most important carbon source for CH(4) production is plant-derived carbon that enters soil as root exudates and debris. Pulse labeling of rice plants with (13)CO(2) resulted in incorporation of (13)C into the ribosomal RNA of Rice Cluster I Archaea in the soil, indicating that this archaeal group plays a key role in CH(4) production from plant-derived carbon. This group of microorganisms has not yet been isolated but appears to be of global environmental importance.
