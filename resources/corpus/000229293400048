Biochemistry - A scientific umbrella
Bringing together key aspects of biology and chemistry, biochemistry lies at the center of modern research in life science. The field has expanded significantly in recent years with the emergence of such pursuits as genomics and proteomics. But the discipline's ability to integrate chemical and biological principles in the effort to understand the nature and function of cells remains unchanged. There is one difference: Modern biochemists must work hard to understand the fresh advances enabled by those two subfields and to apply them to fundamental understanding.
What do employers and academic supervisors expect of biochemists today? In this survey, representatives of academic, governmental, and industrial organizations outline their specific needs. They have two common themes: Scientifically, applicants for jobs and high-level training in biochemistry need a good publication record. And beyond the lab, would-be professionals in biochemistry must show a mastery of communication skills, both oral and written.
