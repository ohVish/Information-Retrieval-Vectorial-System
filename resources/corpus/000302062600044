Cotranscriptional Role for Arabidopsis DICER-LIKE 4 in Transcription Termination
Transcription termination is emerging as an important component of gene regulation necessary to partition the genome and minimize transcriptional interference. We have discovered a role for the Arabidopsis RNA silencing enzyme DICER-LIKE 4 (DCL4) in transcription termination of an endogenous Arabidopsis gene, FCA. DCL4 directly associates with FCA chromatin in the 3' region and promotes cleavage of the nascent transcript in a domain downstream of the canonical polyA site. In a dcl4 mutant, the resulting transcriptional read-through triggers an RNA interference-mediated gene silencing of a transgene containing the same 3' region. We conclude that DCL4 promotes transcription termination of the Arabidopsis FCA gene, reducing the amount of aberrant RNA produced from the locus.
