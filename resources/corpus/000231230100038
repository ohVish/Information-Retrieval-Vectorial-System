Atomic-scale sources and mechanism of nanoscale electronic disorder in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+delta
The randomness of dopant atom distributions in cuprate high-critical temperature superconductors has long been suspected to cause nanoscale electronic disorder. In the superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+delta, we identified populations of atomic-scale impurity states whose spatial densities follow closely those of the oxygen dopant atoms. We found that the impurity-state locations are strongly correlated with all manifestations of the nanoscale electronic disorder. This disorder occurs via an unanticipated mechanism exhibiting high-energy spectral weight shifts, with associated strong superconducting coherence peak suppression but very weak scattering of low-energy quasi-particles.
