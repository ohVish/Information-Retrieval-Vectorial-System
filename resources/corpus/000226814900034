Saturn's temperature field from high-resolution middle-infrared imaging
Saturn was imaged between 8 and 24.5 micrometers at similar to3000-kilometer resolution with the Keck I Telescope. Saturn's atmosphere has zonal temperature bands, which are mostly uncorrelated with visible cloud reflectivity, strong 100-millibar zonal temperature oscillations near 32degreesS, a warm south polar cap, and a compact hot point within 3degrees of the south pole.
