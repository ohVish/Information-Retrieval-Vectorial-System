Polarity-Switching Top Coats Enable Orientation of Sub-10-nm Block Copolymer Domains
Block copolymers (BCPs) must necessarily have high interaction parameters (chi), a fundamental measure of block incompatibility, to self-assemble into sub-10-nanometer features. Unfortunately, a high chi often results from blocks that have disparate interfacial energies, which makes the formation of useful thin-film domain orientations challenging. To mitigate interfacial forces, polymers composed of maleic anhydride and two other components have been designed as top coats that can be spin-coated from basic aqueous solution in the ring-opened, acid salt form. When baked, the anhydride reforms and switches polarity to create a neutral layer enabling BCP feature alignment not possible by thermal annealing alone. Top coats were applied to the lamella-forming block copolymers poly(styrene-block-trimethylsilylstyrene-block-styrene) and poly(trimethylsilylstyrene-block-lactide), which were thermally annealed to produce perpendicular features with linewidths of 15 and 9 nanometers, respectively.
