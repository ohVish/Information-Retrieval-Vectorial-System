Transport of peptide-MHC class II complexes in developing dendritic cells
Major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) molecules capture peptides within the endocytic pathway to generate T cell receptor (TCR) ligands. Immature dendritic cells (DCs) sequester intact antigens in Lysosomes, processing and converting antigens into peptide-MHC II complexes upon induction of DC maturation. The complexes then accumulate in distinctive, nonlysosomal MHC II+ vesicles that appear to migrate to the cell surface. Although the vesicles exclude soluble lysosomal contents and antigen-processing machinery, many contain MHC I and B7 costimulatory molecules. After arrival at the cell surface, the MHC and costimulatory molecules remain clustered. Thus, transport of peptide-MHC II complexes by DCs not only accomplishes transfer from late endocytic compartments to the plasma membrane, but does so in a manner that selectively concentrates TCR ligands and costimulatory molecules for T cell contact.
