Selective etching of metallic carbon nanotubes by gas-phase reaction
Metallic and semiconducting carbon nanotubes generally coexist in as-grown materials. We present a gas-phase plasma hydrocarbonation reaction to selectively etch and gasify metallic nanotubes, retaining the semiconducting nanotubes in near-pristine form. With this process, 100% of purely semiconducting nanotubes were obtained and connected in parallel for high-current transistors. The diameter- and metallicity-dependent "dry" chemical etching approach is scalable and compatible with existing semiconductor processing for future integrated circuits.
