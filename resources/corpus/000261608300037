Collective Reactivity of Molecular Chains Self-Assembled on a Surface
Self- assembly of molecules on surfaces is a route toward not only creating structures, but also engineering chemical reactivity afforded by the intermolecular interactions. Dimethyldisulfide (CH(3)SSCH(3)) molecules self- assemble into linear chains on single- crystal gold surfaces. Injecting low- energy electrons into individual molecules in the self- assembled structures with the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope led to a propagating chemical reaction along the molecular chain as sulfur- sulfur bonds were broken and then reformed to produce new CH(3)SSCH(3) molecules. Theoretical and experimental evidence supports a mechanism involving electron attachment followed by dissociation of a CH(3)SSCH(3) molecule and initiation of a chain reaction by one or both of the resulting CH(3)S intermediates.
