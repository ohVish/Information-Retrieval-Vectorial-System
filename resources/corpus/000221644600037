Predator diversity dampens trophic cascades
Food web complexity is thought to weaken the strength of terrestrial trophic cascades(1-3) in which strong impacts of natural enemies on herbivores cascade to influence primary production indirectly(4). Predator diversity can enhance food web complexity because predators may feed on each other and on shared prey(5-7). In such cases, theory suggests that the impact of predation on herbivores relaxes and cascading effects on basal resources are dampened(8,9). Despite this view, no empirical studies have explicitly investigated the role of predator diversity in mediating primary productivity in a natural terrestrial system(10,11). Here we compare, in a coastal marsh community, impacts of arthropod predators on herbivores and plant productivity between a simple food web with a single predator species and a complex food web with a diverse predator assemblage. We show that enhancing predator diversity dampens enemy effects on herbivores and weakens trophic cascades. Consequently, changes in diversity at higher trophic levels can significantly alter ecosystem function in natural systems.
