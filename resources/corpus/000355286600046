Defining fundamental steps in the assembly of the Drosophila RNAi enzyme complex
SmallRNAs suchas small interfering RNAs(siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) silence the expression of their complementary target messenger RNAs1,2 via the formation of effector RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs), which contain Argonaute (Ago) family proteins at their core. Although loading of siRNA duplexes into Drosophila Ago2 requires the Dicer-2-R2D2 heterodimer(3-5) and the Hsc70/Hsp90 (Hsp90 also known as Hsp83) chaperone machinery6-8, the details of RISC assembly remain unclear. Here we reconstitute RISC assembly using only Ago2, Dicer-2, R2D2, Hsc70, Hsp90, Hop, Droj2 (an Hsp40 homologue) and p23. By following the assembly of single RISC molecules, we find that, in the absence of the chaperone machinery, an siRNA bound to Dicer-2-R2D2 associates with Ago2 only transiently. The chaperone machinery extends the dwell time of the Dicer-2-R2D2-siRNA complex on Ago2, in a manner dependent on recognition of the 59-phosphate on the siRNA guide strand. We propose that the chaperone machinery supports a productive state of Ago2, allowing it to load siRNA duplexes from Dicer-2-R2D2 and thereby assemble RISC.
