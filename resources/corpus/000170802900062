Duration of nuclear NF-kappa B action regulated by reversible acetylation
The nuclear expression and action of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) transcription factor requires signal-coupled phosphorylation and degradation of the I kappaB inhibitors, which normally bind and sequester this pleiotropically active factor in the cytoplasm. The subsequent molecular events that regulate the termination of nuclear NF-kappaB action remain poorly defined, although the activation of de novo I kappaB alpha gene expression by NF-kappaB likely plays a key rote. Our studies now demonstrate that the RelA subunit of NF-kappaB is subject to inducible acetylation and that acetylated forms of RelA interact weakly, if at all, with I kappaB alpha. Acetytated RelA is subsequently deacetylated through a specific interaction with histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3). This deacetylation reaction promotes effective binding to I kappaB alpha and leads in turn to I kappaB alpha -dependent nuclear export of the complex through a chromosomal region maintenance-1 (CRM-1)-dependent pathway. Deacetylation of RelA by HDAC3 thus acts as an intranuclear molecular switch that both controls the duration of the NF-kappaB transcriptional response and contributes to the replenishment of the depleted cytoplasmic pool of latent NF-kappaB-I kappaB alpha complexes.
