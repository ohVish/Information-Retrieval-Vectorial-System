Air-stable all-inorganic nanocrystal solar cells processed from solution
We introduce an ultrathin donor-acceptor solar cell composed entirely of inorganic nanocrystals spin-cast from solution. These devices are stable in air, and post-fabrication processing allows for power conversion efficiencies approaching 3% in initial tests. This demonstration elucidates a class of photovoltaic devices with potential for stable, tow-cost power generation.
