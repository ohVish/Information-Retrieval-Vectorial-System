Next-generation genetics in plants
Natural variation presents one of the fundamental challenges of modern biology. Soon, the genome sequences of thousands of individuals will be known for each of several species. But how does the genotypic variation that will be observed among these individuals translate into phenotypic variation? Plants are in many ways ideal for addressing this question, and resources that are unmatched, except in humans, have now been developed.
