RNA interference
A conserved biological response to double-stranded RNA, known variously as RNA interference (RNA) or post-transcriptional gene silencing, mediated resistance to both endogenous parasitic and exogenous pathogenic nucleic acids, and regulates the expression of protein-coding genes. RNAi has been cultivated as a means to manipulate gene expression experimentally and to probe gene function on a whole-genome scale.
