TOPLESS mediates auxin-dependent transcriptional repression during Arabidopsis embryogenesis
The transcriptional response to auxin is critical for root and vascular development during Arabidopsis embryogenesis. Auxin induces the degradation of AUXIN/ INDOLE- 3- ACETIC ACID ( AUX/ IAA) transcriptional repressors, freeing their binding partners, the AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR ( ARF) proteins, which can activate transcription of auxin response genes. We show that TOPLESS ( TPL) can physically interact with IAA12/ BODENLOS ( IAA12/ BDL) through an ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR ( ERF) - associated amphiphilic repression ( EAR) motif. TPL can repress transcription in vivo and is required for IAA12/ BDL repressive activity. In addition, tpl- 1 can suppress the patterning defects of the bdl- 1 mutant. Direct interaction between TPL and ARF5/ MONOPTEROS, which is regulated by IAA12/ BDL, results in a loss- of- function arf5/ mp phenotype. These observations show that TPL is a transcriptional co- repressor and further our understanding of how auxin regulates transcription during plant development.
