Protein interaction mapping in C-elegans using proteins involved in vulval development
Protein interaction mapping using large-scale two-hybrid analysis has been proposed as a way to functionally annotate large numbers of uncharacterized proteins predicted by complete genome sequences. This approach was examined in Caenorhabditis elegans, starting with 27 proteins involved in vulval development. The resulting map reveals both known and new potential interactions and provides a functional annotation for approximately 100 uncharacterized gene products. A protein interaction mapping project is now feasible for C. elegans on a genome-wide scale and should contribute to the understanding of molecular mechanisms in this organism and in human diseases.
