Hanbury Brown Twiss effect for ultracold quantum gases
We have studied two-body correlations of atoms in an expanding cloud above and below the Bose-Einstein condensation threshold. The observed correlation function for a thermal cloud shows a bunching behavior, whereas the correlation is flat for a coherent sample. These quantum correlations are the atomic analog of the Hanbury Brown Twiss effect. We observed the effect in three dimensions and studied its dependence on cloud size.
