NSP1 of the GRAS protein family is essential for rhizobial Nod factor-induced transcription
Rhizobial Nod factors induce in their legume hosts the expression of many genes and set in motion developmental processes leading to root nodule formation. Here we report the identification of the Medicago GRAS-type protein Nodulation signaling pathway 1 (NSP1), which is essential for all known Nod factor-induced changes in gene expression. NSP1 is constitutively expressed, and so it acts as a primary transcriptional regulator mediating all known Nod factor-induced transcriptional responses, and therefore, we named it a Nod factor response factor.
