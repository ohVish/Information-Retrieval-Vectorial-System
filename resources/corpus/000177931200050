Ocean circulation and climate during the past 120,000 years
Oceans cover more than two-thirds of our blue planet. The waters move in a global circulation system, driven by subtle density differences and transporting huge amounts of heat. Ocean circulation is thus an active and highly nonlinear player in the global climate game. Increasingly clear evidence implicates ocean circulation in abrupt and dramatic climate shifts, such as sudden temperature changes in Greenland on the order of 5-10degreesC and massive surges of icebergs into the North Atlantic Ocean - events that have occurred repeatedly during the last glacial cycle.
