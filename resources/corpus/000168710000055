Cancer genetics
Cancer genetics has for many years focused on mutational events that have their primary effect within the cancer cell. Recently that focus has widened, with evidence of the importance of epigenetic events and of cellular interactions in cancer development. The role of common genetic variation in determining the range of individual susceptibility within the population is increasingly recognized, and will be addressed using information from the Human Genome Project. These new research directions will highlight determinants of cancer that lie outside the cancer cell, suggest new targets for intervention, and inform the design of strategies for prevention in groups at increased risk.
