Homogeneous catalysis - new approaches to catalyst separation, recovery, and recycling
Homogeneous catalysts have many attractive properties, such as high selectivities. However, many homogeneous catalytic systems cannot be commercialized because of difficulties associated with separating the products from the catalyst. Recent approaches to tackling this problem are reviewed and compared.
