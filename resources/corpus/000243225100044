Hsp70 regulates erythropoiesis by preventing caspase-3-mediated cleavage of GATA-1
Caspase-3 is activated during both terminal differentiation and erythropoietin-starvation-induced apoptosis of human erythroid precursors. The transcription factor GATA-1, which performs an essential function in erythroid differentiation(1,2) by positively regulating promoters of erythroid and anti-apoptotic genes(3-6), is cleaved by caspases in erythroid precursors undergoing cell death upon erythropoietin starvation or engagement of the death receptor Fas(7,8). In contrast, by an unknown mechanism, GATA-1 remains uncleaved when these cells undergo terminal differentiation upon stimulation with Epo(9-11). Here we show that during differentiation, but not during apoptosis, the chaperone protein Hsp70 protects GATA-1 fromcaspase-mediated proteolysis. At the onset of caspase activation, Hsp70 co-localizes and interacts with GATA-1 in the nucleus of erythroid precursors undergoing terminal differentiation. In contrast, erythropoietin starvation induces the nuclear export of Hsp70 and the cleavage of GATA-1. In an in vitro assay, Hsp70 protects GATA-1 from caspase-3-mediated proteolysis through its peptide-binding domain. The use of RNA-mediated interference to decrease the Hsp70 content of erythroid precursors cultured in the presence of erythropoietin leads to GATA-1 cleavage, a decrease in haemoglobin content, downregulation of the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-X(L), and cell death by apoptosis. These effects are abrogated by the transduction of a caspase-resistant GATA-1 mutant. Thus, in erythroid precursors undergoing terminal differentiation, Hsp70 prevents active caspase-3 from cleaving GATA-1 and inducing apoptosis.
