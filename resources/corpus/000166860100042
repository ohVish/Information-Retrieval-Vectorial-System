The Indian Ocean Experiment: Widespread air pollution from South and Southeast Asia
The Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX) was an international, multiplatform field campaign to measure Long-range transport of air pollution from South and Southeast Asia toward the Indian Ocean during the dry monsoon season in January to March 1999. Surprisingly high pollution Levels were observed over the entire northern Indian Ocean toward the Intertropical Convergence Zone at about 6 degreesS. We show that agricultural burning and especially biofuel use enhance carbon monoxide concentrations. Fossil fuel combustion and biomass burning cause a high aerosol Loading. The growing pollution in this region gives rise to extensive air quality degradation with Local, regional, and global implications, including a reduction of the oxidizing power of the atmosphere.
