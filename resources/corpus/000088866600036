A [2]catenane-based solid state electronically reconfigurable switch
A solid state, electronically addressable, bistable [2]catenane-based molecular switching device was fabricated from a single monolayer of the [2]catenane, anchored with phospholipid counterions, and sandwiched between an n-type polycrystalline silicon bottom electrode and a metallic top electrode. The device exhibits hysteretic (bistable) current/voltage characteristics. The switch is opened at +2 volts, closed at -2 volts, and read at similar to 0.1 volt and may be recycled many times under ambient conditions. A mechanochemical mechanism for the action of the switch is presented and shown to be consistent with temperature-dependent measurements of the device operation.
