Enriched Pt-Re-Os isotope systematics in plume lavas explained by metasomatic sulfides
To explain the elevated osmium isotope ( (Os-187Os)-Os-186) signatures in oceanic basalts, the possibility of material flux from the metallic core into the crust has been invoked. This hypothesis conflicts with theoretical constraints on Earth's thermal and dynamic history. To test the veracity and uniqueness of elevated Os-186-Os-187 in tracing core- mantle exchange, we present highly siderophile element analyses of pyroxenites, eclogites plus their sulfides, and new Os-186/Os-188 measurements on pyroxenites and platinum- rich alloys. Modeling shows that involvement in the mantle source of either bulk pyroxenite or, more likely, metasomatic sulfides derived from either pyroxenite or peridotite melts can explain the Os-186-Os-187 signatures of oceanic basalts. This removes the requirement for core- mantle exchange and provides an effective mechanism for generating Os isotope diversity in basalt source regions.
