Deep drilling into the Chesapeake Bay impact structure
Samples from a 1.76- kilometer- deep corehole drilled near the center of the late Eocene Chesapeake Bay impact structure ( Virginia, USA) reveal its geologic, hydrologic, and biologic history. We conducted stratigraphic and petrologic analyses of the cores to elucidate the timing and results of impact- melt creation and distribution, transient- cavity collapse, and ocean- water resurge. Comparison of post- impact sedimentary sequences inside and outside the structure indicates that compaction of the crater fill influenced long- term sedimentation patterns in the mid- Atlantic region. Salty connate water of the target remains in the crater fill today, where it poses a potential threat to the regional groundwater resource. Observed depth variations in microbial abundance indicate a complex history of impact- related thermal sterilization and habitat modification, and subsequent post- impact repopulation.
