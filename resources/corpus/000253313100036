The search for new cardiovascular biomarkers
Despite considerable advances in the treatment of cardiovascular disease, it remains the leading cause of death in developed countries. Assessment of classic cardiovascular risk factors-including high blood pressure, diabetes and smoking-has a central role in disease prevention. However, many individuals with coronary heart disease (a narrowing of the blood vessels that supply the heart) have only one, or none, of the classic risk factors. Thus, new biomarkers are needed to augment the information obtained from traditional indicators and to illuminate disease mechanisms.
