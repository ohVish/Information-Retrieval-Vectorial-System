A mitotic septin scaffold required for mammalian chromosome congression and segregation
Coordination of cytokinesis with chromosome congression and segregation is critical for proper cell division, but the mechanism is unknown. Here, septins, a conserved family of polymerizing guanosine triphosphate-binding proteins, localized to the metaphase plate during mitosis. Septin depletion resulted in chromosome loss from the metaphase plate, lack of chromosome segregation and spindle elongation, and incomplete cytokinesis upon delayed mitotic exit. These defects correlated with loss of the mitotic motor and the checkpoint regulator centromere-associated protein E (CENP-E) from the kinetochores of congressing chromosomes. Mammalian septins may thus form a mitotic scaffold for CENP-E and other effectors to coordinate cytokinesis with chromosome congression and segregation.
