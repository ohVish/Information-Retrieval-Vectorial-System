Local and Long-Range Reciprocal Regulation of cAMP and cGMP in Axon/Dendrite Formation
Cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) often mediate antagonistic cellular actions of extracellular factors, from the regulation of ion channels to cell volume control and axon guidance. We found that localized cAMP and cGMP activities in undifferentiated neurites of cultured hippocampal neurons promote and suppress axon formation, respectively, and exert opposite effects on dendrite formation. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer imaging showed that alterations of the amount of cAMP resulted in opposite changes in the amount of cGMP, and vice versa, through the activation of specific phosphodiesterases and protein kinases. Local elevation of cAMP in one neurite resulted in cAMP reduction in all other neurites of the same neuron. Thus, local and long-range reciprocal regulation of cAMP and cGMP together ensures coordinated development of one axon and multiple dendrites.
