The immunopathogenesis of sepsis
Sepsis is a condition that results from a harmful or damaging host response to infection. Many of the components of the innate immune response that are normally concerned with host defences against infection can, under some circumstances, cause cell and tissue damage and hence multiple organ failure, the clinical hallmark of sepsis. Because of the high mortality of sepsis in the face of standard treatment, many efforts have been made to improve understanding of the dysregulation of the host response in sepsis. As a result, much has been learnt of the basic principles governing bacterial-host interactions, and new opportunities for therapeutic intervention have been revealed.
