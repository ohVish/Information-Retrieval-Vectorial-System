Quantum state transfer between matter and light
We report on the coherent quantum state transfer from a two-level atomic system to a single photon. Entanglement between a single photon (signal) and a two-component ensemble of cold rubidium atoms is used to project the quantum memory element (the atomic ensemble) onto any desired state by measuring the signal in a suitable basis. The atomic qubit is read out by stimulating directional emission of a single photon (idler) from the (entangled) collective state of the ensemble. Faithful atomic memory preparation and readout are verified by the observed correlations between the signal and the idler photons. These results enable implementation of distributed quantum networking.
