Direct dating of Early Upper Palaeolithic human remains from Mladec
The human fossil assemblage from the Mladec. Caves in Moravia ( Czech Republic)(1) has been considered to derive from a middle or later phase of the Central European Aurignacian period on the basis of archaeological remains ( a few stone artefacts and organic items such as bone points, awls, perforated teeth)(2), despite questions(3) of association between the human fossils and the archaeological materials and concerning the chronological implications of the limited archaeological remains(4). The morphological variability in the human assemblage, the presence of apparently archaic features in some specimens, and the assumed early date of the remains have made this fossil assemblage pivotal in assessments of modern human emergence within Europe(5-7). We present here the first successful direct accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon dating of five representative human fossils from the site. We selected sample materials from teeth and from one bone for C-14 dating. The four tooth samples yielded uncalibrated ages of similar to 31,000 C-14 years before present, and the bone sample ( an ulna) provided an uncertain more-recent age. These data are sufficient to confirm that the Mladec. human assemblage is the oldest cranial, dental and postcranial assemblage of early modern humans in Europe and is therefore central to discussions of modern human emergence in the northwestern Old World and the fate of the Neanderthals.
