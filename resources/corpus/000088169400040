ORCA3, a jasmonate-responsive transcriptional regulator of plant primary and secondary metabolism
Biosynthesis of many classes of secondary metabolites in plants is induced by the stress hormone jasmonate. The gene for ORCA3, a jasmonate-responsive APETALA2 (AP2)-domain transcription factor from Catharanthus roseus, was isolated by transferred DNA activation tagging. Orca3 overexpression resulted in enhanced expression of several metabolite biosynthetic genes and, consequently, in increased accumulation of terpenoid indole alkaloids, Regulation of metabolite biosynthetic genes by jasmonate-responsive AP2-domain transcription factors may link plant stress responses to changes in metabolism.
