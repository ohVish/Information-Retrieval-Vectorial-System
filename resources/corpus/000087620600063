Searching for genetic determinants in the new millennium
Human genetics is now at a critical juncture. The molecular methods used successfully to identify the genes underlying rare mendelian syndromes are failing to find the numerous genes causing more common, familial, non-mendelian diseases. With the human genome sequence nearing completion, new opportunities are being presented for unravelling the complex genetic basis of non-mendelian disorders based on large-scale genome-wide studies. Considerable debate has arisen regarding the best approach to take. In this review I discuss these issues, together with suggestions for optimal post-genome strategies.
