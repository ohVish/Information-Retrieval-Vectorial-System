Application of the Marcus cross relation to hydrogen atom transfer reactions
The transfer of a hydrogen atom-a proton and an electron-is a fundamental process in chemistry and biology. A variety of hydrogen atom transfer reactions, involving iron complexes, phenols, hydroxylamines, (BuOOH)-Bu-t, toluene, and related radicals, are shown to follow the Marcus cross relation. Thus, the Marcus theory formalism based on ground-state energetics and self-exchange rates, originally developed for electron transfer processes, is also valuable for hydrogen atom transfer. Compounds that undergo slow proton transfer (C-H bonds) or slow electron transfer (cobalt complexes) also undergo slow hydrogen atom transfer. Limitations of this approach are also discussed.
