TDP-43 mutations in familial and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS) is a fatal motor neuron disorder characterized pathologically by ubiquitinated TAR DNA binding protein ( TDP- 43) inclusions. The function of TDP- 43 in the nervous system is uncertain, and a mechanistic role in neurodegeneration remains speculative. We identified neighboring mutations in a highly conserved region of TARDBP in sporadic and familial ALS cases. TARDBP(M337V) segregated with disease within one kindred and a genome- wide scan confirmed that linkage was restricted to chromosome 1p36, which contains the TARDBP locus. Mutant forms of TDP- 43 fragmented in vitro more readily than wild type and, in vivo, caused neural apoptosis and developmental delay in the chick embryo. Our evidence suggests a pathophysiological link between TDP- 43 and ALS.
