A nebular origin for chondritic fine-grained phyllosilicates
Hydrated minerals occur in accretionary rims around chondrules in CM chondrites. Previous models suggested that these phyllosilicates did not form by gas-solid reactions in the canonical solar nebula. We propose that chondrule-forming shock waves in icy regions of the nebula produced conditions that allowed rapid mineral hydration. The time scales for phyllosilicate formation are similar to the time it takes for a shocked system to cool from the temperature of phyllosilicate stability to that of water ice condensation. This scenario allows for simultaneous formation of chondrules and their fine-grained accretionary rims.
