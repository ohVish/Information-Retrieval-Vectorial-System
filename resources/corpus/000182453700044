Requirement of Cks2 for the first metaphase/anaphase transition of mammalian meiosis
We generated mice lacking Cks2, one of two mammalian homologs of the yeast Cdk1-binding proteins, Suc1 and Cks1, and found them to be viable but sterile in both sexes. Sterility is due to failure of both male and female germ cells to progress past the first meiotic metaphase. The chromosomal events up through the end of prophase I are normal in both CKS2(-/-) males and females, suggesting that the phenotype is due directly to failure to enter anaphase and not a consequence of a checkpoint-mediated metaphase I arrest.
