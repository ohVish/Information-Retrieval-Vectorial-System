The development of neural stem cells
The discovery of stem cells that can generate neural tissue has raised new possibilities for repairing the nervous system. A rush of papers proclaiming adult stem cell plasticity has fostered the notion that there is essentially one stem cell type that, with the right impetus, can create whatever progeny our heart, liver or other vital organ desires. But studies aimed at understanding the role of stem cells during development have led to a different view-that stem cells are restricted regionally and temporally, and thus not all stem cells are equivalent. Can these views be reconciled?.
