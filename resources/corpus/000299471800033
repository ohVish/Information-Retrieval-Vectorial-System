Transiting circumbinary planets Kepler-34 b and Kepler-35 b
Most Sun-like stars in the Galaxy reside in gravitationally bound pairs of stars(1,2) (binaries). Although long anticipated(3-8), the existence of a 'circumbinary planet' orbiting such a pair of normal stars was not definitively established until the discovery(9) of the planet transiting (that is, passing in front of) Kepler-16. Questions remained, however, about the prevalence of circumbinary planets and their range of orbital and physical properties. Here we report two additional transiting circumbinary planets: Kepler-34 (AB)b and Kepler-35 (AB)b, referred to here as Kepler-34 b and Kepler-35 b, respectively. Each is a low-density gas-giant planet on an orbit closely aligned with that of its parent stars. Kepler-34 b orbits two Sun-like stars every 289 days, whereas Kepler-35 b orbits a pair of smaller stars (89% and 81% of the Sun's mass) every 131 days. The planets experience large multi-periodic variations in incident stellar radiation arising from the orbital motion of the stars. The observed rate of circumbinary planets in our sample implies that more than similar to 1% of close binary stars have giant planets in nearly coplanar orbits, yielding a Galactic population of at least several million.
