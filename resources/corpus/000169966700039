Impact of polymer tether length on multiple ligand-receptor bond formation
The promoters of cell adhesion are ligands, which are often attached to flexible tethers that bind to surface receptors on adjacent cells. Using a combination of Monte Carte simulations, diffusion reaction theory, and direct experiments (surface force measurements) of the biotin-streptavidin system, we have quantified polymer chain dynamics and the kinetics and spatial range of tethered ligand-receptor binding. The results show that the efficiency of strong binding does not depend solely on the molecular architecture or binding energy of the receptor-ligand pair, nor on the equilibrium configuration of the polymer tether, but rather on its "rare" extended conformations.
