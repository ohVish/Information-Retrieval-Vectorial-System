Superconducting interfaces between insulating oxides
At interfaces between complex oxides, electronic systems with unusual electronic properties can be generated. We report on superconductivity in the electron gas formed at the interface between two insulating dielectric perovskite oxides, LaAlO3 and SrTiO3. The behavior of the electron gas is that of a two-dimensional superconductor, confined to a thin sheet at the interface. The superconducting transition temperature of congruent to 200 millikelvin provides a strict upper limit to the thickness of the superconducting layer of congruent to 10 nanometers.
