Toll-like receptors in the induction of the innate immune response
The innate immune response is the first line of defence against infectious disease. The principal challenge for the host is to detect the pathogen and mount a rapid defensive response. A group of proteins that comprise the Toll or Toll-like family of receptors perform this role in vertebrate and invertebrate organisms. This reflects a remarkable conservation of function and it is therefore not surprising that studies of the mechanism by which they act has revealed new and important insights into host defence.
