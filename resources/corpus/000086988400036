N-cadherin, a cell adhesion molecule involved in establishment of embryonic left-right asymmetry
Within the bilaterally symmetric vertebrate body plan, many organs develop asymmetrically, Here, it is demonstrated that a cell adhesion molecule, N-cadherin, is one of the earliest proteins to be asymmetrically expressed in the chicken embryo and that its activity is required during gastrulation for proper establishment of the Left-right axis. Blocking N-cadherin function randomizes heart Looping and alters the expression of Snail and Pitx2, Later components of the molecular cascade thar regulate left-right asymmetry. However, the expression of other components of this cascade (Nodal and Lefty) was unchanged after blocking N-cadherin function, suggesting the existence of parallel pathways in the establishment of Left-right morphogenesis. Here, the results suggest that N-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion events are required for establishment of left-right asymmetry.
