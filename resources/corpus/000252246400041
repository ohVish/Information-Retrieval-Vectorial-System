DNA oxidation as triggered by H3K9me2 demethylation drives estrogen-induced gene expression
Modifications at the N- terminal tails of nucleosomal histones are required for efficient transcription in vivo. We analyzed how H3 histone methylation and demethylation control expression of estrogen- responsive genes and show that a DNA- bound estrogen receptor directs transcription by participating in bending chromatin to contact the RNA polymerase II recruited to the promoter. This process is driven by receptor- targeted demethylation of H3 lysine 9 at both enhancer and promoter sites and is achieved by activation of resident LSD1 demethylase. Localized demethylation produces hydrogen peroxide, which modifies the surrounding DNA and recruits 8- oxoguanine- DNA glycosylase 1 and topoisomerase II beta, triggering chromatin and DNA conformational changes that are essential for estrogen- induced transcription. Our data show a strategy that uses controlled DNA damage and repair to guide productive transcription.
