A new carnivorous dinosaur from the Late Jurassic Solnhofen archipelago
Small Late Jurassic theropod dinosaurs are rare worldwide. In Europe these carnivorous dinosaurs are represented primarily by only two skeletons of Compsognathus(1,2), neither of which is well preserved. Here we describe a small new theropod dinosaur from the Late Jurassic period of Schamhaupten in southern Germany(3,4). Being exquisitely preserved and complete from the snout to the distal third of the tail, the new fossil is the best- preserved predatory, non- avian dinosaur in Europe. It possesses a suite of characters that support its identification as a basal coelurosaur. A cladistic analysis indicates that the new taxon is closer to maniraptorans than to tyrannosauroids, grouping it with taxa often considered to be compsognathids. Large portions of integument are preserved along its tail. The absence of feathers or feather- like structures in a fossil phylogenetically nested within feathered theropods(5,6) indicates that the evolution of these integumentary structures might be more complex than previously thought.
