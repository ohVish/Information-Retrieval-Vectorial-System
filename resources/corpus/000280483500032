Ultrathin PbS Sheets by Two-Dimensional Oriented Attachment
Controlling anisotropy is a key concept in the generation of complex functionality in advanced materials. For this concept, oriented attachment of nanocrystal building blocks, a self-assembly of particles into larger single-crystalline objects, is one of the most promising approaches in nanotechnology. We report here the two-dimensional oriented attachment of lead sulfide (PbS) nanocrystals into ultrathin single-crystal sheets with dimensions on the micrometer scale. We found that this process is initiated by cosolvents, which alter nucleation and growth rates during the primary nanocrystal formation, and is finally driven by dense packing of oleic acid ligands on {100} facets of PbS. The obtained nanosheets can be readily integrated in a photodetector device without further treatment.
