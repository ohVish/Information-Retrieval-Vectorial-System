Structure of the cytochrome b(6)f complex of oxygenic photosynthesis: Tuning the cavity
The cytochrome b(6)f complex provides the electronic connection between the photosystem I and photosystem II reaction centers of oxygenic photosynthesis and generates a transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient for adenosine triphosphate synthesis. A 3.0 angstrom crystal structure of the dimeric b(6)f complex from the thermophilic cyanobacterium Mastigocladus laminosus reveals a large quinone exchange cavity, stabilized by lipid, in which plastoquinone, a quinone-analog inhibitor, and a novel heme are bound. The core of the b(6)f complex is similar to the analogous respiratory cytochrome bc(1) complex, but the domain arrangement outside the core and the complement of prosthetic groups are strikingly different. The motion of the Rieske iron-sulfur protein extrinsic domain, essential for electron transfer, must also be different in the b(6)f complex.
