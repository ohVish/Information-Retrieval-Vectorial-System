Neodymium isotope evidence for a chondritic composition of the Moon
Samarium-neodymium isotope data for six lunar basalts show that the bulk Moon has a Nd-142/Nd-144 ratio that is indistinguishable from that of chondritic meteorites but is 20 parts per million less than most samples from Earth. The Sm/Nd formation interval of the lunar mantle from these data is 215(-21)(+23) million years after the onset of solar system condensation. Because both Earth and the Moon likely formed in the same region of the solar nebula, Earth should also have a chondritic bulk composition. In order to mass balance the Nd budget, these constraints require that a complementary reservoir with a lower Nd-142/Nd-144 value resides in Earth's mantle.
