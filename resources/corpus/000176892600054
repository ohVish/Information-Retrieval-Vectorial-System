Integrin-mediated long-term B cell retention in the splenic marginal zone
The mechanisms that control localization of marginal zone (MZ) B cells are poorly understood. Here we show that MZ B cells express elevated levels of the integrins LFA-1 (alphaLbeta2) and alpha4beta1 and that they bind to the ligands ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. These ligands are expressed within the MZ in a lymphotoxin-dependent manner. Combined inhibition of LFA-1 and alpha4beta1 causes a rapid and selective release of B cells from the MZ. Furthermore, lipopolysaccharide-triggered MZ B cell relocalization involves down-regulation of integrin-mediated adhesion. These studies identify key requirements for MZ B cell localization and establish a role for integrins in peripheral lymphoid tissue compartmentalization.
