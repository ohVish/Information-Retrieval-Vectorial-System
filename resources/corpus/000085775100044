Stable sulphate clusters as a source of new atmospheric particles
The formation of new atmospheric particles with diameters of 3-10 nn has been observed at a variety of altitudes and locations. Such aerosol particles have the potential to grow into cloud condensation nuclei, thus affecting cloud formation as well as the global radiation budget. In some cases, the observed formation rates of new particles have been adequately explained by binary nucleation, involving water and sulphuric acid(1), but in certain locations-particularly those within the marine boundary layer(1,2) and at continental sites(1,3)-observed ambient nucleation rates exceed those predicted by the binary scheme. In these locations, ambient sulphuric acid (H2SO4) levels are typically lower than required for binary nucleation(1), but ape sufficient for ternary nucleation(4) (sulphuric acid-ammonia-water). Here we present results from an aerosol dynamics model with a ternary nucleation scheme which indicate that nucleation in the troposphere should be ubiquitous, and yield a reservoir of thermodynamically stable clusters 1-3 nn in size. We suggest that the growth of these clusters to a delectable size (> 3 nm particle diameter) is restricted by the availability of condensable vapour. Observations of atmospheric particle formation and growth from a continental and a coastal sire support this hypothesis, indicating that a growth process including ternary nucleation is likely to be responsible for the formation of cloud condensation nuclei.
