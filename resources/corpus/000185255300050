Antiretroviral drugs for tuberculosis control in the era of HIV/AIDS
Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/ AIDS) has dramatically increased the incidence of tuberculosis (TB) in sub-Saharan Africa, where up to 60% of TB patients are coinfected with HIV and each year 200,000 TB deaths are attributable to HIV coinfection. Now HIV threatens control of TB in Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America. Antiretroviral ( ARV) drugs can prevent TB by preserving immunity, but cohort analysis shows that early therapy, plus high levels of coverage and compliance, will be needed to avert a significant fraction of TB cases. However, ARV drugs could enhance the treatment of TB, and TB programs provide an important entry point for the treatment of HIV/ AIDS.
