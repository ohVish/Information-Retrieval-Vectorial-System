Structural basis for specific cleavage of Lys 63-linked polyubiquitin chains
Deubiquitinating enzymes ( DUBs) remove ubiquitin from conjugated substrates to regulate various cellular processes. The Zn(2+)-dependent DUBs AMSH and AMSH- LP regulate receptor trafficking by specifically cleaving Lys 63- linked polyubiquitin chains from internalized receptors. Here we report the crystal structures of the human AMSH- LP DUB domain alone and in complex with a Lys 63- linked di- ubiquitin at 1.2 angstrom and 1.6 angstrom resolutions, respectively. The AMSH- LP DUB domain consists of a Zn(2+)-coordinating catalytic core and two characteristic insertions, Ins- 1 and Ins- 2. The distal ubiquitin interacts with Ins- 1 and the core, whereas the proximal ubiquitin interacts with Ins- 2 and the core. The core and Ins- 1 form a catalytic groove that accommodates the Lys 63 side chain of the proximal ubiquitin and the isopeptide- linked carboxy- terminal tail of the distal ubiquitin. This is the first reported structure of a DUB in complex with an isopeptide- linked ubiquitin chain, which reveals the mechanism for Lys 63- linkage- specific deubiquitination by AMSH family members.
