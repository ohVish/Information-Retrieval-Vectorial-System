Radiation tolerance of complex oxides
The radiation performance of a variety of complex oxides is predicted on the basis of a material's propensity to accommodate lattice point defects. The calculations indicate that a particular class of oxides possessing the fluorite crystal structure should accept radiation-induced defects into their Lattices far more readily than a structurally similar class of oxides based on the pyrochlore crystal structure. Preliminary radiation damage experiments substantiate the prediction that fluorites are inherently more radiation resistant than pyrochlores, These results may permit the chemical durability and radiation tolerance of potential hosts for actinides and radioactive wastes to be tailored.
