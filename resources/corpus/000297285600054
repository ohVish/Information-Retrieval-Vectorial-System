Dendritic cells control lymphocyte entry to lymph nodes through high endothelial venules
While patrolling the body in search of foreign antigens, naive lymphocytes continuously circulate from the blood, through the lymph nodes, into the lymphatic vessels and back to the blood(1,2). This process, called lymphocyte recirculation, provides the body with effective immune surveillance for foreign invaders and for alterations to the body's own cells. However, the mechanisms that regulate lymphocyte recirculation during homeostasis remain incompletely characterized. Here we show that dendritic cells (DCs), which are well known for their role in antigen presentation to T lymphocytes(3), control the entry of naive lymphocytes to lymph nodes by modulating the phenotype of high endothelial venules (HEVs), which are blood vessels specialized in lymphocyte recruitment(2,4,5). We found that in vivo depletion of CD11c(+) DCs in adult mice over a 1-week period induces a reduction in the size and cellularity of the peripheral and mucosal lymph nodes. In the absence of DCs, the mature adult HEV phenotype reverts to an immature neonatal phenotype, and HEV-mediated lymphocyte recruitment to lymph nodes is inhibited. Co-culture experiments showed that the effect of DCs on HEV endothelial cells is direct and requires lymphotoxin-beta-receptor-dependent signalling. DCs express lymphotoxin, and DC-derived lymphotoxin is important for lymphocyte homing to lymph nodes in vivo. Together, our results reveal a previously unsuspected role for DCs in the regulation of lymphocyte recirculation during immune surveillance.
