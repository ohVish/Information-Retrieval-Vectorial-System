alpha-klotho as a regulator of calcium homeostasis
alpha-klotho was identified as a gene associated with premature aging-like phenotypes characterized by short lifespan. In mice, we found the molecular association of alpha-Klotho (alpha-Kl) and Na(+), K(+)-adenosine triphosphatase (Na(+), K(+)-ATPase) and provide evidence for an increase of abundance of Na(+), K(+)-ATPase at the plasma membrane. Low concentrations of extracellular free calcium ([Ca(2+)](e)) rapidly induce regulated parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion in an alpha-Kl- and Na(+), K(+)-ATPase-dependent manner. The increased Na(+) gradient created by Na(+), K(+)-ATPase activity might drive the transepithelial transport of Ca(2+) in cooperation with ion channels and transporters in the choroid plexus and the kidney. Our findings reveal fundamental roles of alpha-Kl in the regulation of calcium metabolism.
