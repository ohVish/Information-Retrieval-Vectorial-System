Drivers of biodiagnostic development
The promise of point-of-care medical diagnostics - tests that can be carried out at the site of patient care is enormous, bringing the benefits of fast and reliable testing and allowing rapid decisions on the course of treatment to be made. To this end, much innovation is occurring in technologies for use in biodiagnostic tests. Assays based on nanomaterials, for example, are now beginning to make the transition from the laboratory to the clinic. But the potential for such assays to become part of routine medical testing depends on many scientific factors, including sensitivity, selectivity and versatility, as well as technological, financial and policy factors.
