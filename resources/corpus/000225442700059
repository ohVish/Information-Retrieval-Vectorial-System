A probabilistic functional network of yeast genes
A conceptual framework for integrating diverse functional genomics data was developed by reinterpreting experiments to provide numerical likelihoods that genes are functionally linked. This allows direct comparison and integration of different classes of data. The resulting probabilistic gene network estimates the functional coupling between genes. Within this framework, we reconstructed an extensive, high-quality functional gene network for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, consisting of 4681 (similar to81%) of the known yeast genes linked by similar to34,000 probabilistic linkages comparable in accuracy to small-scale interaction assays. The integrated linkages distinguish true from false-positive interactions in earlier data sets; new interactions emerge from genes' network contexts, as shown for genes in chromatin modification and ribosome biogenesis.
