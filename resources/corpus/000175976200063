Probing protein electrostatics with a synthetic fluorescent amino acid
Electrostatics affect virtually all aspects of protein structure and activity and are particularly important in proteins whose primary function is to stabilize charge. Here we introduce a fluorescent amino acid, Aladan, which can probe the electrostatic character of a protein at multiple sites. Aladan is exceptionally sensitive to the polarity of its surroundings and can be incorporated site-selectively at buried and exposed sites, in both soluble and membrane proteins. Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence measurements of Aladan residues at different buried and exposed sites in the B1 domain of protein G suggest that its interior is polar and heterogeneous.
