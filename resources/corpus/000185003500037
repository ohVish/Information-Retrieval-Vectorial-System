Synthesis of carbenes through substitution reactions at a carbene center
An(amino)(phosphino) carbene can be transformed into(amino)(phosphonio) carbenes, which undergo nucleophilic intermolecular as well as intramolecular substitution reactions at the carbene center. A variety of carbenes can be synthesized starting from a single carbene precursor. The resulting gamut of electronic and steric effects possible should open the way not only to a detailed study of the mechanism, but also to the subsequent improvement of catalytic reactions that involve carbene-transition metal complexes.
