Structures of neutral Au-7, Au-19, and Au-20 clusters in the gas phase
The catalytic properties of gold nanoparticles are determined by their electronic and geometric structures. We revealed the geometries of several small neutral gold clusters in the gas phase by using vibrational spectroscopy between 47 and 220 wavenumbers. A two- dimensional structure for neutral Au-7 and a pyramidal structure for neutral Au-20 can be unambiguously assigned. The reduction of the symmetry when a corner atom is cut from the tetrahedral Au-20 cluster is directly reflected in the vibrational spectrum of Au-19.
