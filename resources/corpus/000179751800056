Navigating the signalling network in mouse cardiac myocytes
Cardiac myocytes have a complex network of signals that regulates their essential role in the rhythmic pumping of the heart. This network is an appealing model system in which to study the basic principles underlying cellular signalling mechanisms. Progress in this effort has come through the establishment of standardized myocyte isolation and culture procedures and characterization of important signalling responses.
