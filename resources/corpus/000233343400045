Small-molecule inhibition of TNF-alpha
We have identified a small-molecule inhibitor of tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-alpha) that promotes subunit disassembly of this trimeric cytokine family member. The compound inhibits TNF-alpha activity in biochemical and cell-based assays with median inhibitory concentrations of 22 and 4.6 micromolar, respectively. Formation of an intermediate complex between the compound and the intact trimer results in a 600-fold accelerated subunit dissociation rate that leads to trimer dissociation. A structure solved by x-ray crystallography reveals that a single compound molecule displaces a subunit of the trimer to form a complex with a dimer of TNF-alpha subunits.
