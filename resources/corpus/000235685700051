Development of the signal in sensory rhodopsin and its transfer to the cognate transducer
The microbial phototaxis receptor sensory rhodopsin II ( NpSRII, also named phoborhodopsin) mediates the photophobic response of the haloarchaeon Natronomonas pharaonis(1,2) by modulating the swimming behaviour of the bacterium(3). After excitation by blue-green light NpSRII triggers, by means of a tightly bound transducer protein ( NpHtrII), a signal transduction chain homologous with the two-component system of eubacterial chemotaxis(4). Two molecules of NpSRII and two molecules of NpHtrII form a 2: 2 complex in membranes as shown by electron paramagnetic resonance(5) and X-ray structure analysis(6). Here we present X-ray structures of the photocycle intermediates K and late M (M(2)) explaining the evolution of the signal in the receptor after retinal isomerization and the transfer of the signal to the transducer in the complex. The formation of late M has been correlated with the formation of the signalling state(2,7). The observed structural rearrangements allow us to propose the following mechanism for the light-induced activation of the signalling complex. On excitation by light, retinal isomerization leads in the K state to a rearrangement of a water cluster that partly disconnects two helices of the receptor. In the transition to late M the changes in the hydrogen bond network proceed further. Thus, in late M state an altered tertiary structure establishes the signalling state of the receptor. The transducer responds to the activation of the receptor by a clockwise rotation of about 158 of helix TM2 and a displacement of this helix by 0.9 angstrom at the cytoplasmic surface.
