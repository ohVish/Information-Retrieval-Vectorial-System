A chiral route to negative refraction
Negative refraction is currently achieved by driving the magnetic permeability and electrical permittivity simultaneously negative, thus requiring two separate resonances in the refracting material. The introduction of a single chiral resonance leads to negative refraction of one polarization, resulting in improved and simplified designs of negatively refracting materials and opening previously unknown avenues of investigation in this fast-growing subject.
