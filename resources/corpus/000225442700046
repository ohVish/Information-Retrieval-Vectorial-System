The ethylene signaling pathway
Plants use a structurally very simple gas molecule, the hydrocarbon ethylene, to modulate various developmental programs and coordinate responses to a multitude of external stress factors. How this simple molecule generates such a diverse array of effects has been the subject of intense research for the past two decades. A fascinating signaling pathway, with classical as well as novel plant-specific signaling elements, is emerging from these studies. We describe the four main modules that constitute this signaling pathway: a phosphotransfer relay, an EIN2-based unit, a ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation component, and a transcriptional cascade. The canonical and Arabidopsis ethylene signaling pathways in the Signal Transduction Knowledge Environment Connections Maps provide a complete panoramic view of these signaling events in plants.
