A structural model of transcription elongation
The path of the nucleic acids through a transcription elongation complex was tracked by mapping cross-links between bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) and transcript RNA or template DNA onto the x-ray crystal structure. In the resulting model, the downstream duplex DNA is nestled in a trough formed by the beta' subunit and enclosed an top by the beta subunit. In the RNAP channel, the RNA/DNA hybrid extends from the enzyme active site, along a region of the beta subunit harboring rifampicin resistance mutations, to the beta' subunit "rudder. The single-stranded RNA is then extruded through another channel formed by the beta-subunit flap domain. The model provides insight into the functional properties of the transcription complex.
