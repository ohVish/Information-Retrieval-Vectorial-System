Carbenes As Catalysts for Transformations of Organometallic Iron Complexes
Compared with the enormous arsenal of catalysts used to produce organic compounds, complementary species that are able to mediate sophisticated organometallic transformations are virtually nonexistent. We found that stable N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) can mediate unusual organometallic transformations in solution at room temperature. Depending on the choice of NHC initiator, stoichiometric or catalytic reactions of bis(cyclooctatetraene) iron [Fe(COT)(2)] ensue. The stoichiometric reaction leads to the isolation of a previously unknown mixed-valent species, featuring distinct and directly bonded Fe(0) and Fe(1) centers. In the catalytic process, three iron atoms are fused to afford the tri-iron cluster Fe(3)(COT)(3), which is a hydrocarbon analog of Dewar's classic Fe(3)(CO)(12) complex. The key step in both of these processes is proposed to involve the NHC's ability to induce metal-metal bond formation. These NHC-mediated reactions provide a foundation on which to develop future organometallic transformations that are catalyzed by organic species.
