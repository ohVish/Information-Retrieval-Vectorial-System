Functional materials based on self-assembly of polymeric supramolecules
Self-assembty of polymeric supramolecules is a powerful too[ for producing functional materials that combine several properties and may respond to external conditions. We illustrate the concept using a comb-shaped architecture. Examples include the hexagonal self-organization of conjugated conducting polymers and the polarized luminance in solid-state films of rodlike polymers obtained by removing the hydrogen-bonded side chains from the aligned thermotropic smectic phase. Hierarchically structured materials obtained by applying different self-organization and recognition principles and directed assembly form a basis for tunable nanoporous materials, smart membranes, preparation of nano-objects, and anisotropic properties, such as proton conductivity.
