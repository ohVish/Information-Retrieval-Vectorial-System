SWAP-70 is a guanine-nucleotide-exchange factor that mediates signalling of membrane ruffling
Phosphoinositide-3-OH kinase (PI(3) K), activated through growth factor stimulation, generates a lipid second messenger, phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5) P-3)(1-5). PtdIns(3,4,5) P-3 is instrumantal in signalling pathways that trigger cell activation, cytoskeletal rearrangement, survival and other reactions. However, some targets of PtdIns( 3,4,5) P3 are yet to be discovered(1-7). We demonstrate that SWAP-70, a unique signalling protein(8-10), specifically binds PtdIns(3,4,5) P-3.On stimulation by growth factors, cytoplasmic SWAP-70, which is dependent on PI(3) K but independent of Ras, moved to cell membrane rearrangements known as ruffles. However, mutant SWAP-70 lacking the ability to bind PtdIns(3, 4, 5) P-3 blocked membrane ruffling induced by epidermal growth factor or platelet-derived growth factor. SWAP-70 shows low homology with Rac-guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), and catalyses PtdIns( 3,4,5) P-3-dependent guanine nucleotide exchange to Rac. SWAP-70-deficient fibroblasts showed impaired membrane ruffling after stimulation with epidermal growth factor, and failed to activate Rac fully. We conclude that SWAP-70 is a new type of Rac-GEF which, independently of Ras, transduces signals from tyrosine kinase receptors to Rac.
