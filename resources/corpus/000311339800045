Albedo and atmospheric constraints of dwarf planet Makemake from a stellar occultation
Pluto and Eris are icy dwarf planets with nearly identical sizes, comparable densities and similar surface compositions as revealed by spectroscopic studies(1,2). Pluto possesses an atmosphere whereas Eris does not; the difference probably arises from their differing distances from the Sun, and explains their different albedos(3). Makemake is another icy dwarf planet with a spectrum similar to Eris and Pluto(4), and is currently at a distance to the Sun intermediate between the two. Although Makemake's size (1,420 +/- 60 km) and albedo are roughly known(5,6), there has been no constraint on its density and there were expectations that it could have a Pluto-like atmosphere(4,7,8). Here we report the results from a stellar occultation by Makemake on 2011 April 23. Our preferred solution that fits the occultation chords corresponds to a body with projected axes of 1,430 +/- 9 km (1 sigma) and 1,502 +/- 45 km, implying a V-band geometric albedo p(V) = 0.77 +/- 0.03. This albedo is larger than that of Pluto, but smaller than that of Eris. The disappearances and reappearances of the star were abrupt, showing that Makemake has no global Pluto-like atmosphere at an upper limit of 4-12 nano-bar (1 sigma) for the surface pressure, although a localized atmosphere is possible. A density of 1.7 +/- 0.3 g cm(-3) is inferred from the data.
