The elemental composition of asteroid 433 Eros: Results of the NEAR-Shoemaker x-ray spectrometer
We report major element composition ratios for regions of the asteroid 433 Eros imaged during two solar flares and quiet sun conditions during the period of May to July 2000, Low aluminum abundances for all regions argue against global differentiation of Eros. Magnesium/silicon, aluminum/silicon, calcium/silicon, and iron/silicon ratios are best interpreted as a relatively primitive, chondritic composition. Marked depletions in sulfur and possible aluminum and calcium depletions, relative to ordinary chondrites, may represent signatures of Limited partial melting or impact volatilization.
