Optimal transsaccadic integration explains distorted spatial perception
We scan our surroundings with quick eye movements called saccades, and from the resulting sequence of images we build a unified percept by a process known as transsaccadic integration. This integration is often said to be flawed, because around the time of saccades, our perception is distorted(1-6) and we show saccadic suppression of displacement (SSD): we fail to notice if objects change location during the eye movement(7,8). Here we show that transsaccadic integration works by optimal inference. We simulated a visuomotor system with realistic saccades, retinal acuity, motion detectors and eye-position sense, and programmed it to make optimal use of these imperfect data when interpreting scenes. This optimized model showed human-like SSD and distortions of spatial perception. It made new predictions, including tight correlations between perception and motor action (for example, more SSD in people with less-precise eye control) and a graded contraction of perceived jumps; we verified these predictions experimentally. Our results suggest that the brain constructs its evolving picture of the world by optimally integrating each new piece of sensory or motor information.
