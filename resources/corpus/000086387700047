Dilational processes accompanying earthquakes in the Long Valley Caldera
Regional distance seismic moment tensor determinations and broadband wave-forms of moment magnitude 4.6 to 4.9 earthquakes from a November 1997 Long Valley Caldera swarm, during an inflation episode, display evidence of anomalous seismic radiation characterized by non-double couple (NDC) moment tensors with significant volumetric components. Observed coseismic dilation suggests that hydrothermal or magmatic processes are directly triggering some of the seismicity in the region. Similarity in the NDC solutions implies a common source process, and the anomalous events may have been triggered by net fault-normal stress reduction due to high-pressure fluid injection or pressurization of fluid-saturated faults due to magmatic heating.
