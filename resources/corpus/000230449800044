The kinesin Klp2 mediates polarization of interphase microtubules in fission yeast
Fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) cells grow longitudinally in a manner dependent on a polarized distribution of their interphase microtubules. We found that this distribution required sliding of microtubules toward the cell center along preexisting microtubules. This sliding was mediated by the minus end-directed kinesin motor Klp2, which helped microtubules to become properly organized with plus ends predominantly oriented toward the cell ends and minus ends toward the cell center. Thus, interphase microtubules in the fission yeast require motor activities for their proper organization.
