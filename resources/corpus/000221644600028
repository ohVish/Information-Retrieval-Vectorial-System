Quality assessment of the human genome sequency
As the final sequencing of the human genome has now been completed, we present the results of the largest examination of the quality of the finished DNA sequence. The competed study covers the major contributing sequencing centres and is based on a rigorous combination of laboratory experiments and computational analysis.
