A phylogenomic study of birds reveals their evolutionary history
Deep avian evolutionary relationships have been difficult to resolve as a result of a putative explosive radiation. Our study examined similar to 32 kilobases of aligned nuclear DNA sequences from 19 independent loci for 169 species, representing all major extant groups, and recovered a robust phylogeny from a genome- wide signal supported by multiple analytical methods. We documented well- supported, previously unrecognized interordinal relationships ( such as a sister relationship between passerines and parrots) and corroborated previously contentious groupings ( such as flamingos and grebes). Our conclusions challenge current classifications and alter our understanding of trait evolution; for example, some diurnal birds evolved from nocturnal ancestors. Our results provide a valuable resource for phylogenetic and comparative studies in birds.
