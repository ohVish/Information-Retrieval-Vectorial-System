Pre-unfolding resonant oscillations of single green fluorescent protein molecules
Fluorescence spectroscopy of a green fluorescent protein mutant at single-molecule resolution has revealed a remarkable oscillatory behavior that can also be driven by applied fields. We show that immediately before unfolding, several periodic oscillations among the chemical substates of the protein chromophore occur. We also show that applied alternating electric or acoustic fields, when tuned to the protein characteristic frequencies, give rise to strong resonance effects.
