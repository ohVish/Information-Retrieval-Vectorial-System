Insects as chemosensors of humans and crops
Insects transmit disease to hundreds of millions of people a year, and cause enormous losses to the world's agricultural output. Many insects find the human or plant hosts on which they feed, and identify and locate their mates, primarily through olfaction and taste. Major advances have recently been made in understanding insect chemosensation at the molecular and cellular levels. These advances have provided new opportunities to control insects that cause massive damage to health and agriculture across the world.
