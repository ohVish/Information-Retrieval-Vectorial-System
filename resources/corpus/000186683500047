DNA-templated carbon nanotube field-effect transistor
The combination of their electronic properties and dimensions makes carbon nanotubes ideal building blocks for molecular electronics. However, the advancement of carbon nanotube-based electronics requires assembly strategies that allow their precise localization and interconnection. Using a scheme based on recognition between molecular building blocks, we report the realization of a self-assembled carbon nanotube field-effect transistor operating at room temperature. A DNA scaffold molecule provides the address for precise localization of a semiconducting single-wall carbon nanotube as well as the template for the extended metallic wires contacting it.
