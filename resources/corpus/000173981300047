Efficient near-infrared polymer nanocrystat light-emitting diodes
Conjugated polymers and indium arsenide-based nanocrystals were used to create near-infrared plastic light-emitting diodes. Emission was tunable from 1 to 1.3 micrometers-a range that effectively covers the short-wavelength telecommunications band-by means of the quantum confinement effects in the nanocrystals. The external efficiency value (photons out divided by electrons in) is similar to0.5% (that is, >1% internal) and is mainly limited by device architecture. The near-infrared emission did not overlap the charge-induced absorption bands of the polymer.
