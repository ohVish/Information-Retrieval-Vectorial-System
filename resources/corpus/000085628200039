Salmonella pathogenicity island 2-dependent evasion of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase
A type III protein secretion system encoded by Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 (SPI2) has been found to be required for virulence and survival within macrophages. Here, SPI2 was shown to allow Salmonella typhimurium to avoid NADPH oxidase-dependent killing by macrophages. The ability of SPI2-mutant bacteria to survive in macrophages and to cause Lethal infection in mice was restored by abrogation of the NADPH oxidase-dependent respiratory burst. Ultrastructural and immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated efficient Localization of the NADPH oxidase in the proximity of vacuoles containing SPI2-mutant but not wild-type bacteria, suggesting that SPI2 interferes with trafficking of oxidase-containing vesicles to the phagosome.
