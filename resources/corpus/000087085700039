Thermally fluctuating superconductors in two dimensions
In many two-dimensional superconducting systems(1-4), such as Josephson-junction arrays, granular superconducting films, and the high-temperature superconductors, it appears that the electrons bind into Cooper pairs below a pairing temperature (T-P) that is well above the Kosterlitz-Thouless temperature (T-KT, the temperature below which there is long-range superconducting order(5-10)). The electron dynamics at temperatures between T-KT and TP involve a complex interplay of thermal and quantum fluctuations, for which no quantitative theory exists. Here we report numerical results for this region, by exploiting its proximity to a T = 0 superconductor-insulator quantum phase transition(11,12). This quantum critical point need not be experimentally accessible for our results to apply. We characterize the static, thermodynamic properties by a single dimensionless parameter, gamma(T). Quantitative and universal results are obtained for the frequency dependence of the conductivity, which are dependent only upon gamma(T) and fundamental constants of nature.
