Barium isotopes in chondritic meteorites: Implications for planetary reservoir models
High-precision barium isotope measurements yielded differences of up to 25 parts per million in the Ba-137/Ba-136 ratio and 60 parts per million in the Ba-138/Ba-136 ratio between chondrites and Earth. These differences probably arose from incomplete mixing of nucleosynthetic material in the solar nebula. Chondritic meteorites have a slight excess of supernova-derived material as compared to Earth, demonstrating that the solar nebula was not perfectly homogenized upon formation.
