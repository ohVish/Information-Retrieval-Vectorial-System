Regulation of CD45 alternative splicing by heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein, hnRNPLL
The transition from naive to activated T cells is marked by alternative splicing of pre- mRNA encoding the transmembrane phosphatase CD45. Using a short hairpin RNA interference screen, we identified heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein L- like ( hnRNPLL) as a critical inducible regulator of CD45 alternative splicing. HnRNPLL was up- regulated in stimulated T cells, bound CD45 transcripts, and was both necessary and sufficient for CD45 alternative splicing. Depletion or overexpression of hnRNPLL in B and T cell lines and primary T cells resulted in reciprocal alteration of CD45RA and RO expression. Exon array analysis suggested that hnRNPLL acts as a global regulator of alternative splicing in activated T cells. Induction of hnRNPLL during hematopoietic cell activation and differentiation may allow cells to rapidly shift their transcriptomes to favor proliferation and inhibit cell death.
