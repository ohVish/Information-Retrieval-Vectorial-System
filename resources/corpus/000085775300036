Seismic images of the far side of the Sun
Images of an active region on the far side of the sun were derived by applying seismic holography to recent helioseismic observations from space. Active regions are the centers of energetic phenomena such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections, whose resulting electromagnetic and particle radiation interfere with telecommunications and power transmissions on Earth and can pose significant hazards to astronauts and spacecraft. Synoptic seismic imaging of far-side solar activity will now allow anticipation of the appearance of Large active regions more than a week ahead of their arrival on the east solar Limb.
