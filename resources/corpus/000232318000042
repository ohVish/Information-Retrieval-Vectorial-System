Dynamic paternity allocation as a function of male plumage color in barn swallows
Paternity in mate animals can be influenced by their phenotypic signals of quality. Accordingly, the behavior underlying patterns of paternity should be flexible as signals of quality change. To evaluate the dynamics of paternity allocation, we analyzed paternity before and after manipulating plumage coloration, a known signal of quality, in mate barn swallows Hirundo rustica. We found that, in successive breeding bouts, only mates whose plumage color was experimentally enhanced received greater paternity from their social mates, demonstrating evidence for flexible and dynamic paternity allocation and the importance for males of maintaining signals of quality wet[ after pair bond formation.
