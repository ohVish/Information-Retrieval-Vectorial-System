Correlation between nanosecond X-ray flashes and stick-slip friction in peeling tape
Relative motion between two contacting surfaces can produce visible light, called triboluminescence(1). This concentration of diffuse mechanical energy into electromagnetic radiation has previously been observed to extend even to X-ray energies(2). Here we report that peeling common adhesive tape in a moderate vacuum produces radio and visible emission(3,4), along with nanosecond, 100-mW X- ray pulses that are correlated with stick - slip peeling events. For the observed 15- keV peak in X- ray energy, various models(5,6) give a competing picture of the discharge process, with the length of the gap between the separating faces of the tape being 30 or 300 mm at the moment of emission. The intensity of X- ray triboluminescence allowed us to use it as a source for X- ray imaging. The limits on energies and flash widths that can be achieved are beyond current theories of tribology.
