Adaptive immune responses in acute and chronic hepatitis C virus infection
The hepatitis C virus (HCV) persists in the majority of infected individuals and is a significant cause of human illness and death globally. Recent studies have yielded important insights into immunity to HCV, in particular revealing the central role of T cells in viral control and clearance. Other key features of adaptive immune responses remain obscure, including mechanisms by which T cells control HCV replication, the role of antibodies in conferring protection and how cellular and humoral immunity are subverted in persistent infection.
