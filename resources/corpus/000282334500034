Allosteric Supramolecular Triple-Layer Catalysts
Allosteric regulation of organometallic catalysts could allow for greater control over reactions. We report an allosteric supramolecular structure in which a monometallic catalytic site has been buried in the middle layer of a triple-layer complex. Small molecules and elemental anions can open and close this complex and reversibly expose and conceal the catalytic center. The ring-opening polymerization of e-caprolactone can be turned on by the in situ opening of the triple-layer complex and then completely turned off by reforming it through the abstraction of Cl(-), the allosteric effector agent, without appreciable loss of catalytic activity. This process can regulate the molecular weights of the resulting polymers.
