Vesicle formation at the plasma membrane and trans-Golgi network: The same but different
An elaborate vesicle transport system supports the active exchange of membranes and protein cargo between the plasma membrane and the trans-Golgi network. Many observations suggest that highly conserved mechanisms are used in vesicle formation and scission. Such similarity is found both at the level of the receptor-ligand sequestration process that uses clathrin and associated polymeric and monomeric adaptor proteins, and in the machinery used to deform and vesiculate lipid membranes.
