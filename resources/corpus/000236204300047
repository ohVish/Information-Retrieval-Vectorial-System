Immunological reversal of autoimmune diabetes without hematopoietic replacement of beta cells
Type 1 diabetes mellitus results from the autoimmune destruction of the beta cells of the pancreatic islets of Langerhans and is recapitulated in the nonobese diabetic strain of mice. In an attempt to rescue islet loss, diabetic mice were made normoglycemic by islet transplantation and immunization with Freund's complete adjuvant along with multiple injections of allogeneic mate splenocytes. This treatment allowed for survival of transplanted islets and recovery of endogenous beta cell function in a proportion of mice, but with no evidence for allogeneic splenocyte-derived differentiation of new islet beta cells. Control of the autoimmune disease at a crucial time in diabetogenesis can result in recovery of beta cell function.
