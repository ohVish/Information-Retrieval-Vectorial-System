Proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis in cancer
Beneath the complexity and idiopathy of every cancer lies a limited number of 'mission critical' events that have propelled the tumour cell and its progeny into uncontrolled expansion and invasion. One of these is deregulated cell proliferation, which, together with the obligate compensatory suppression of apoptosis needed to support it, provides a minimal 'platform' necessary to support further neoplastic progression. Adroit targeting of these critical events should have potent and specific therapeutic consequences.
