Control of a mucosal challenge and prevention of AIDS by a multiprotein DNA/MVA vaccine
Heterologous prime/boost regimens have the potential for raising high Levels of immune responses. Here we report that DNA priming followed by a recombinant modified vaccinia Ankara (rMVA) booster controlled a highly pathogenic immunodeficiency virus challenge in a rhesus macaque model. Both the DNA and rMVA components of the vaccine expressed multiple immunodeficiency virus proteins. Two DNA inoculations at 0 and 8 weeks and a single rMVA booster at 24 weeks effectively controlled an intrarectal challenge administered 7 months after the booster. These findings provide hope that a relatively simple multiprotein DNA/MVA vaccine can help to control the acquired immune deficiency syndrome epidemic.
