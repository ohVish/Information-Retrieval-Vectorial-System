An Argonaute transports siRNAs from the cytoplasm to the nucleus
Ribonucleoprotein complexes consisting of Argonaute- like proteins and small regulatory RNAs function in a wide range of biological processes. Many of these small regulatory RNAs are predicted to act, at least in part, within the nucleus. We conducted a genetic screen to identify factors essential for RNA interference ( RNAi) in nuclei of Caenorhabditis elegans and identified the Argonaute protein NRDE- 3. In the absence of small interfering RNAs ( siRNAs), NRDE- 3 resides in the cytoplasm. NRDE- 3 binds siRNAs generated by RNA- dependent RNA polymerases acting on messenger RNA templates in the cytoplasm and redistributes to the nucleus. Nuclear redistribution of NRDE- 3 requires a functional nuclear localization signal, is required for nuclear RNAi, and results in NRDE- 3 association with nuclear- localized nascent transcripts. Thus, specific Argonaute proteins can transport specific classes of small regulatory RNAs to distinct cellular compartments to regulate gene expression.
