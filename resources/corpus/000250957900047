Promotion of tissue inflammation by the immune receptor Tim-3 expressed on innate immune cells
CD4(+) T helper 1 (T(H)1) cells are important mediators of inflammation and are regulated by numerous pathways, including the negative immune receptor Tim-3. We found that Tim-3 is constitutively expressed on cells of the innate immune system in both mice and humans, and that it can synergize with Toll-like receptors. Moreover, an antibody agonist of Tim-3 acted as an adjuvant during induced immune responses, and Tim-3 ligation induced distinct signaling events in T cells and dendritic cells; the latter finding could explain the apparent divergent functions of Tim-3 in these cell types. Thus, by virtue of differential expression on innate versus adaptive immune cells, Tim-3 can either promote or terminate T(H)1 immunity and may be able to influence a range of inflammatory conditions.
