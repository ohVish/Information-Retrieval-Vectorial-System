A structural explanation for the binding of endocytic dileucine motifs by the AP2 complex
Most transmembrane proteins are selected as transport- vesicle cargo through the recognition of short, linear amino- acid motifs in their cytoplasmic portions by vesicle coat proteins. For clathrin-coated vesicles, the motifs are recognized by clathrin adaptors. The AP2 adaptor complex (subunits alpha, beta 2, mu 2 and sigma 2) recognizes both major endocytic motifs: Yxx Phi motifs(1) ( where Phi can be F, I, L, Mor V) and [ED] xxxL[ LI] acidic dileucine motifs. Here we describe the binding of AP2 to the endocytic dileucine motif from CD4 ( ref. 2). The major recognition events are the two leucine residues binding in hydrophobic pockets on sigma 2. The hydrophilic residue four residues upstream from the first leucine sits on a positively charged patch made from residues on the sigma 2 and a subunits. Mutations in key residues inhibit the binding of AP2 to 'acidic dileucine' motifs displayed in liposomes containing phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate,but do not affect binding to Yxx Phi motifs through mu 2. In the 'inactive' AP2 core structure(3) both motif- binding sites are blocked by different parts of the beta 2 subunit. To allow a dileucine motif to bind, the beta 2 amino terminus is displaced and becomes disordered; however, in this structure the Yxx Phi-binding site on mu 2 remains blocked.
