Seven-transmembrane-spanning receptors and heart function
Understanding precisely how the heart can recognize and respond to many different extracellular signalling molecules, such as neurotransmitters, hormones and growth factors, will aid the identification of new therapeutic targets through which cardiovascular diseases can be combated. In recent years, we have learned more about the complex interactions that occur between the receptors and the signalling pathways of the heart and its environment. Most of these discoveries have focused on the most common type of cardiac receptor - the seven-transmembrane-spanning receptor or G-protein-coupled receptor.
