Reburial of fossil organic carbon in marine sediments
Marine sediments act as the ultimate sink for organic carbon, sequestering otherwise rapidly cycling carbon for geologic time-scales(1,2). Sedimentary organic carbon burial appears to be controlled by oxygen exposure time in situ(3,4), and much research has focused on understanding the mechanisms of preservation of organic carbon(5). In this context, combustion- derived black carbon has received attention as a form of refractory organic carbon that may be preferentially preserved in soils(6,7) and sediments(8,9). However, little is understood about the environmental roles, transport and distribution of black carbon. Here we apply isotopic analyses to graphitic black carbon samples isolated from pre- industrial marine and terrestrial sediments. We find that this material is terrestrially derived and almost entirely depleted of radiocarbon, suggesting that it is graphite weathered from rocks, rather than a combustion product. The widespread presence of fossil graphitic black carbon in sediments has therefore probably led to significant overestimates of burial of combustion-derived black carbon in marine sediments. It could be responsible for biasing radiocarbon dating of sedimentary organic carbon, and also reveals a closed loop in the carbon cycle. Depending on its susceptibility to oxidation, this recycled carbon may be locked away from the biologically mediated carbon cycle for many geologic cycles.
