The complete genome sequence of Propionibacterium acnes, a commensal of human skin
Propionibacterium acnes is a major inhabitant of adult human skin, where it resides within sebaceous follicles, usually as a harmless commensal although it has been implicated in acne vulgaris formation. The entire genome sequence of this Gram-positive bacterium encodes 2333 putative genes and revealed numerous gene products involved in degrading host molecules, including sialidases, neuraminidases, endoglycoceramidases, lipases, and pore-forming factors. Surface-associated and other immunogenic factors have been identified, which might be involved in triggering acne inflammation and other P. acnes-associated diseases.
