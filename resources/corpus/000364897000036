A brain circuit that synchronizes growth and maturation revealed through Dilp8 binding to Lgr3
Body-size constancy and symmetry are signs of developmental stability. Yet, it is unclear
exactly how developing animals buffer size variation. Drosophila insulin-like peptide Dilp8
is responsive to growth perturbations and controls homeostatic mechanisms that
coordinately adjust growth and maturation to maintain size within the normal range. Here
we show that Lgr3 is a Dilp8 receptor. Through the use of functional and adenosine
3',5'-monophosphate assays, we defined a pair of Lgr3 neurons that mediate homeostatic
regulation. These neurons have extensive axonal arborizations, and genetic and green
fluorescent protein reconstitution across synaptic partners show that these neurons
connect with the insulin-producing cells and prothoracicotropic hormone-producing
neurons to attenuate growth and maturation. This previously unrecognized circuit suggests
how growth and maturation rate are matched and co-regulated according to Dilp8 signals
to stabilize organismal size.
