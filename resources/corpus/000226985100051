Two abundant bioaccumulated halogenated compounds are natural products
Methoxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers (MeO-PBDEs) have been found bioaccumulated in the tissues of a variety of aquatic animals and at concentrations comparable to those of anthropogenic halogenated organic compounds, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The origin of the MeO-PBDEs has been uncertain; circumstantial evidence supports a natural and/or an industrial source. By analyzing the natural abundance radiocarbon content of two MeO-PBDEs isolated from a True's beaked whale (Mesoplodon mirus), we show that these compounds were naturally produced.
