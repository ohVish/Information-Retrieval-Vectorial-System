Step-by-step engineered multiparticle entanglement
After quantum particles have interacted, they generally remain in an entangled state and are correlated at a distance by quantum-mechanical Links that can be used to transmit and process information in nonclassical ways. This implies programmable sequences of operations to generate and analyze the entanglement of complex systems. We have demonstrated such a procedure for two atoms and a single-photon cavity mode, engineering and analyzing a three-particle entangled state by a succession of controlled steps that address the particles individually. This entangling procedure can, in principle, operate on larger numbers of particles, opening new perspectives for fundamental tests of quantum theory.
