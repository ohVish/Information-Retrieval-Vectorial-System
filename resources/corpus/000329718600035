Btk29A Promotes Wnt4 Signaling in the Niche to Terminate Germ Cell Proliferation in Drosophila
Btk29A is the Drosophila ortholog of the mammalian Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), mutations of which in humans cause a heritable immunodeficiency disease. Btk29A mutations stabilized the proliferating cystoblast fate, leading to an ovarian tumor. This phenotype was rescued by overexpression of wild-type Btk29A and phenocopied by the interference of Wnt4-beta-catenin signaling or its putative downstream nuclear protein Piwi in somatic escort cells. Btk29A and mammalian Btk directly phosphorylated tyrosine residues of beta-catenin, leading to the up-regulation of its transcriptional activity. Thus, we identify a transcriptional switch involving the kinase Btk29A/Btk and its phosphorylation target, beta-catenin, which functions downstream of Wnt4 in escort cells to terminate Drosophila germ cell proliferation through up-regulation of piwi expression. This signaling mechanism likely represents a versatile developmental switch.
