Formation of immiscible alloy powders with egg-type microstructure
The egg-type core microstructure where one alloy encases another has previously been obtained during experiments in space. Working with copper-iron base alloys prepared by conventional gas atomization, we were able to obtain this microstructure under gravity conditions. The minor liquid phase always formed the core of the egg, and it sometimes also formed a shell layer. The origin of the formation of this core microstructure can be explained by Marangoni motion on the basis of the temperature dependence of the interfacial energy, which shows that this type of powder can be formed even if the cooling rate is very high.
