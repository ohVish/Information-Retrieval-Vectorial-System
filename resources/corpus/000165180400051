A transcription reinitiation intermediate that is stabilized by activator
High levels of gene transcription by RNA polymerase II depend on high rates of transcription initiation and reinitiation. Initiation requires recruitment of the complete transcription machinery to a promoter, a process facilitated by activators and chromatin remodelling factors. Reinitiation probably occurs through a different pathway(1). After initiation, a subset of the transcription machinery remains at the promoter, forming a platform for assembly of a second transcription complex(2-4). Here we describe the isolation of a reinitiation intermediate that includes transcription factors TFIID, TFIIA, TFIIH, TFIIE and Mediator. This intermediate can act as a scaffold for formation of a functional reinitiation complex. Formation of this scaffold is dependent on ATP and TFIIH. The scaffold is stabilized in the presence of the activator Gal4-VP16, but not Gal4-AH, suggesting a new role for some activators and Mediator in promoting high levels of transcription.
