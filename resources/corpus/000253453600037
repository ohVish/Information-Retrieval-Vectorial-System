Designing metallic glass matrix composites with high toughness and tensile ductility
The selection and design of modern high- performance structural engineering materials is driven by optimizing combinations of mechanical properties such as strength, ductility, toughness, elasticity and requirements for predictable and graceful ( non-catastrophic) failure in service(1). Highly processable bulk metallic glasses ( BMGs) are a new class of engineering materials and have attracted significant technological interest(2-6). Although many BMGs exhibit high strength and show substantial fracture toughness, they lack ductility and fail in an apparently brittle manner in unconstrained loading geometries(7). For instance, some BMGs exhibit significant plastic deformation in compression or bending tests, but all exhibit negligible plasticity (<0.5% strain) in uniaxial tension. To overcome brittle failure in tension, BMG - matrix composites have been introduced(8,9). The inhomogeneous microstructure with isolated dendrites in a BMG matrix stabilizes the glass against the catastrophic failure associated with unlimited extension of a shear band and results in enhanced global plasticity and more graceful failure. Tensile strengths of similar to 1GPa, tensile ductility of similar to 2 - 3 per cent(9), and an enhanced mode I fracture toughness of K-1C approximate to 40 MPa m(1/2) were reported(8,9). Building on this approach, we have developed 'designed composites' by matching fundamental mechanical and microstructural length scales. Here, we report titanium zirconium- based BMG composites with room- temperature tensile ductility exceeding 10 per cent, yield strengths of 1.2 - 1.5 GPa, K-1C up to similar to 170 MPa m(1/)2, and fracture energies for crack propagation as high as G(1C)approximate to 340 kJ m(-2). The K-1C and G(1C) values equal or surpass those achievable in the toughest titanium or steel alloys, placing BMG composites among the toughest known materials.
