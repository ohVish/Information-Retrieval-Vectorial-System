Structure of the Sec13/31 COPII coat cage
Endomembranes of eukaryotic cells are dynamic structures that are in continuous communication through the activity of specialized cellular machineries(1), such as the coat protein complex II ( COPII), which mediates cargo export from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)(2,3). COPII consists of the Sar1 GTPase, Sec23 and Sec24 (Sec23/24), where Sec23 is a Sar1-specific GTPase-activating protein and Sec24 functions in cargo selection, and Sec13 and Sec31 (Sec13/31), which has a structural role(3). Whereas recent results have shown that Sec23/24 and Sec13/31 can self-assemble to form COPII cage-like particles(4), we now show that Sec13/31 can self-assemble to form minimal cages in the absence of Sec23/24. We present a three-dimensional reconstruction of these Sec13/31 cages at 30 angstrom resolution using cryo-electron microscopy and single particle analysis. These results reveal a novel cuboctahedron geometry with the potential to form a flexible lattice and to generate a diverse range of containers. Our data are consistent with a model for COPII coat complex assembly in which Sec23/24 has a non-structural role as a multivalent ligand localizing the self-assembly of Sec13/31 to form a cage lattice driving ER cargo export.
