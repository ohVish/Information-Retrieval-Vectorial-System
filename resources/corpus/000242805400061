Long-lasting arrest of murine polycystic kidney disease with CDK inhibitor roscovitine
Polycystic kidney diseases (PKDs) are primarily characterized by the growth of fluid-filled cysts in renal tubules leading to end-stage renal disease(1-3). Mutations in the PKD1 or PKD2 genes lead to autosomal dominant PKD (ADPKD), a slowly developing adult form(4,5). Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease results from mutations in the PKHD1 gene, affects newborn infants and progresses very rapidly(6,7). No effective treatment is currently available for PKD. A previously unrecognized site of subcellular localization was recently discovered for all proteins known to be disrupted in PKD: primary cilia(8,9). Because ciliary functions seem to be involved in cell cycle regulation, disruption of proteins associated with cilia or centrioles may directly affect the cell cycle and proliferation, resulting in cystic disease(10-12). We therefore reasoned that the dysregulated cell cycle may be the most proximal cause of cystogenesis, and that intervention targeted at this point could provide significant therapeutic benefit for PKD. Here we show that treatment with the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor (R)-roscovitine does indeed yield effective arrest of cystic disease in jck and cpk mouse models of PKD. Continuous daily administration of the drug is not required to achieve efficacy; pulse treatment provides a robust, long-lasting effect, indicating potential clinical benefits for a lifelong therapy. Molecular studies of the mechanism of action reveal effective cell-cycle arrest, transcriptional inhibition and attenuation of apoptosis. We found that roscovitine is active against cysts originating from different parts of the nephron, a desirable feature for the treatment of ADPKD, in which cysts form in multiple nephron segments. Our results indicate that inhibition of CDK is a new and effective approach to the treatment of PKD.
