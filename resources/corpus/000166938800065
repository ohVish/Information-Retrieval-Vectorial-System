A physical map of human chromosome 14
We report the construction of a tiling path of around 650 clones covering more than 99% of human chromosome 14. Clone overlap information to assemble the map was derived by comparing fully sequenced clones with a database of clone end sequences(1,2) (sequence tag connector strategy). We selected homogeneously distributed seed points using an auxiliary high-resolution radiation hybrid map comprising 1,895 distinct positions. The high long-range continuity and low redundancy of the tiling path indicates that the sequence tag connector approach compares favourably with alternative mapping strategies.
