Multiple molecular mechanisms for multidrug resistance transporters
The acquisition of multidrug resistance is a serious impediment to improved healthcare. Multidrug resistance is most frequently due to active transporters that pump a broad spectrum of chemically distinct, cytotoxic molecules out of cells, including antibiotics, antimalarials, herbicides and cancer chemotherapeutics in humans. The paradigm multidrug transporter, mammalian P-glycoprotein, was identified 30 years ago. Nonetheless, success in overcoming or circumventing multidrug resistance in a clinical setting has been modest. Recent structural and biochemical data for several multidrug transporters now provide mechanistic insights into how they work. Organisms have evolved several elegant solutions to ridding the cell of such cytotoxic compounds. Answers are emerging to questions such as how multispecificity for different drugs is achieved, why multidrug resistance arises so readily, and what chance there is of devising a clinical solution.
