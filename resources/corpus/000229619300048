Kinetic evidence for five-coordination in AlOH(aq)(2+) ion
Trivalent aluminum ions are important in natural bodies of water, but the structure of their coordination shell is a complex unsolved problem. In strong acid (pH < 3.0), Al-III exists almost entirely as the octahedral Al(H2O)(6)(3+) ion, whereas in basic conditions (pH > 7), a tetrahedral AI(OH)(4)(-) structure prevails. in the biochemically and geochemically critical pH range of 4.3 to 7.0, the ion structures are less clear. Other hydrolytic species, such as AlOH(aq)(2+), exist and are traditionally assumed to be hexacoordinate. We show, however, that the kinetics of proton and water exchange on aqueous Al-III, coupled with Car-Parrinetto simulations, support a five-coordinate Al(H2O)(4)OH2+ ion as the predominant form of AlOH(aq)(2+) under ambient conditions. This result contrasts Al-III with other trivalent metal aqua ions, for which there is no evidence for stable pentacoordinate hydrolysis products.
