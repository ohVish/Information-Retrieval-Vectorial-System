Observation of electroluminescence and photovoltaic response in ionic junctions
Electronic devices primarily use electronic rather than ionic charge carriers. Using soft-contact lamination, we fabricated ionic junctions between two organic semiconductors with mobile anions and cations, respectively. Mobile ionic charge was successfully deployed to control the direction of electronic current flow in semiconductor devices. As a result, these devices showed electroluminescence under forward bias and a photovoltage upon illumination with visible light. Thus, ionic charge carriers can enhance the performance of existing electronic devices, as well as enable new functionalities.
