Development - Organogenesis - Heart and wood formation from the zebrafish point of view
Organs are specialized tissues used for enhanced physiology and environmental adaptation. The cells of the embryo are genetically programmed to establish organ form and function through conserved developmental modules. The zebrafish is a powerful model system that is poised to contribute to our basic understanding of vertebrate organogenesis. This review develops the theme of modules and illustrates how zebrafish have been particularly useful for understanding heart and blood formation.
