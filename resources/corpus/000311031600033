How cancer metabolism is tuned for proliferation and vulnerable to disruption
Cancer metabolism has received a substantial amount of interest over the past decade. The advances in analytical tools have, along with the rapid progress of cancer genomics, generated an increasingly complex understanding of metabolic reprogramming in cancer. As numerous connections between oncogenic signalling pathways and metabolic activities emerge, the importance of metabolic reprogramming in cancer is being increasingly recognized. The identification of metabolic weaknesses of cancer cells has been used to create strategies for treating cancer, but there are still challenges to be faced in bringing the drugs that target cancer metabolism to the clinic.
