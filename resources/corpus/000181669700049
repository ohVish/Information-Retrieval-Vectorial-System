Identified sources and targets of slow inhibition in the neocortex
There are two types of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in the cerebral cortex. Fast inhibition is mediated by ionotropic gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptors, and slow inhibition is due to metabotropic GABA(B) receptors. Several neuron classes elicit inhibitory postsynaptic potentials through GABA(A) receptors, but possible distinct sources of slow inhibition remain unknown. We identified a class of GABAergic interneurons, the neurogliaform cells, that, in contrast to other GABA-releasing cells, elicited combined GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptor-mediated responses with single action potentials and that predominantly targeted the dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons. Slow inhibition evoked by a distinct interneuron in spatially restricted postsynaptic compartments could locally and selectively modulate cortical excitability.
