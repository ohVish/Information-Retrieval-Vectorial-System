Micro-engineered local field control for high-sensitivity multispectral MRI
In recent years, biotechnology and biomedical research have benefited from the introduction of a variety of specialized nanoparticles whose well-defined, optically distinguishable signatures enable simultaneous tracking of numerous biological indicators. Unfortunately, equivalent multiplexing capabilities are largely absent in the field of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Comparable magnetic-resonance labels have generally been limited to relatively simple chemically synthesized superparamagnetic microparticles that are, to a large extent, indistinguishable from one another. Here we show how it is instead possible to use a top-down microfabrication approach to effectively encode distinguishable spectral signatures into the geometry of magnetic microstructures. Although based on different physical principles from those of optically probed nanoparticles, these geometrically defined magnetic microstructures permit a multiplexing functionality in the magnetic resonance radio-frequency spectrum that is in many ways analogous to that permitted by quantum dots in the optical spectrum. Additionally, in situ modification of particle geometries may facilitate radio-frequency probing of various local physiological variables.
