Small phonon contribution to the photoemission kink in the copper oxide superconductors
Despite over two decades of intense research efforts, the origin of high- temperature superconductivity in the copper oxides remains elusive. Angle- resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments(1,2) have revealed a kink in the dispersion relations ( energy versus wavevector) of electronic states in the copper oxides at binding energies of 50-80 meV, raising the hope that this anomaly could be a key to understanding high- temperature superconductivity. The kink is often interpreted in terms of interactions between the electrons and a bosonic field. Although there is no consensus on the nature of the bosons ( or even whether a boson model is appropriate), both phonons(1) and spin fluctuations(2) have been proposed as possible candidates. Here we report first- principles calculations of the role of phonons and the electron - phonon interaction in the photoemission spectra of La2-xSrxCuO4. Our calculations within the standard formalism demonstrate that the phonon- induced renormalization of the electron energies and the Fermi velocity is almost one order of magnitude smaller than the effect observed in photoemission experiments. Therefore, our result rules out electron - phonon interaction in bulk La2-xSrxCuO4 as the exclusive origin of the measured kink. Our conclusions are consistent with those reached independently in a recent study(3) of the related compound YBa2Cu3O7.
