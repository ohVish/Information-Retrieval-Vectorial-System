Genomics, the cytoskeleton and motility
The draft human genome sequence is an important step in cataloguing the molecular hardware that supports the processes of life. Here I look at what we have learned from the draft sequence about our cytoskeletal and motility systems. Most cytoskeletal and motility proteins were discovered previously by biochemical isolation, traditional cloning methods or random sequences of complementary DNAs. The ongoing challenges of assembling and annotating genes for motor proteins with long, fragmented coding sequences emphasize the importance of expert knowledge of related proteins and confirmatory evidence from cDNA sequences.
