Superconductivity gets an iron boost
Superconductivity, the resistance-free flow of electrical charges, is one of the most exotic phenomena in solid-state physics. Even though it was discovered almost a century ago, many questions remain unanswered, in particular those concerning the physics of high-temperature superconductivity. The recent discovery of iron-based superconductors was arguably the most important breakthrough in this field for more than two decades and may provide new avenues for understanding this high-temperature phenomenon. Here I present my view of the recent developments in this field that have led to the current understanding of this important new class of superconductor.
