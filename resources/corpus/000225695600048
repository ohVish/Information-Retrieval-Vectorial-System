The G(s)-linked receptor GPR3 maintains meiotic arrest in mammalian oocytes
Mammalian oocytes are held in prophase arrest by an unknown signal from the surrounding somatic tells. Here we show that the orphan G(s)-linked receptor GPR3, which is localized in the oocyte, maintains this arrest. Oocytes from Gpr3 knockout mice resume meiosis within antral follicles, independently of an increase in luteinizing hormone, and this phenotype can be reversed by injection of Gpr3 RNA into the oocytes. Thus, the GPR3 receptor is a link in communication between the somatic cells and oocyte of the ovarian follicle and, is crucial for the regulation of meiosis.
