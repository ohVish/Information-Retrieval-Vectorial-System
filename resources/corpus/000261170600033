A Cryptand-Encapsulated Germanium(II) Dication
Unlike cations of metals such as sodium or calcium, oxidized silicon and germanium centers generally require strongly bound covalent ligands. We report the synthesis and characterization of a germanium( II) dication in the form of the salt (Ge.cryptand[ 2.2.2])( O(3)SCF(3))(2). The salt is isolated in 88% yield from the reaction of cryptand [ 2.2.2] and an N- heterocyclic carbene complex of GeCl(O(3)SCF(3)) as an air- sensitive, white solid. The crystal structure of the salt shows minimal interaction between the cryptand- encapsulated germanium( II) ion and the two (-)O(3)SCF(3) counterions. These results suggest a widely expanded role of cryptands and related molecules in stabilizing nonmetallic cations.
