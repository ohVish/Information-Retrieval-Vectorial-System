Involvement of cellular caveolae in bacterial entry into mast cells
Caveolae are subcellular structures implicated in the import and transcytosis of macromolecules and in transmembrane signaling. To date, evidence for the existence of caveolae in hematopoietic cells has been ambiguous. Caveolae were detected in the microvilli and intracellular vesicles of cultured mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs). CD48, a receptor for FimH-expressing (type 1 fimbriated) Escherichia coli, was specifically Localized to plasmalemmal caveolae in BMMCs, The involvement of caveolae in bacterial entry into BMMCs was indicated because caveolae-disrupting and -usurping agents specifically blocked E, coli entry, and markers of caveolae were actively recruited to sites of bacterial entry. The formation of bacteria-encapsulating caveolar chambers in BMMCs represents a distinct mechanism of microbial entry into phagocytes.
