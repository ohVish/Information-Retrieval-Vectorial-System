Growth of Uniformly Oriented Silica MFI and BEA Zeolite Films on Substrates
Applications of zeolite films benefit from alignment of the integrated channels, but methods for film growth have nearly always introduced orientational randomization in the direction normal to the substrate. We now report facile methods to grow silicalite-1 films and pure silica beta zeolite films on substrates with straight or sinusoidal channels positioned uniformly upright at a thickness of up to 8 micrometers. Precise gel compositions and processing temperatures are critical to promote secondary growth on pre-formed oriented crystal monolayers while suppressing self-crystallization in the bulk medium. Preliminary results highlight the potential of these uniformly oriented films in the nonlinear optical response and separation of xylene isomers.
