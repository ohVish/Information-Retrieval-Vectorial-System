Autoimmune dilated cardiomyopathy in PD-1 receptor-deficient mice
Dilated cardiomyopathy is a severe pathology of the heart with poorly understood etiology. Disruption of the gene encoding the negative immunoregulatory receptor PD-1 in BALB/c mice, but not in BALB/c RAG-2(-/-) mice, caused dilated cardiomyopathy with severely impaired contraction and sudden death by congestive heart failure. Affected hearts showed diffuse deposition of immunoglobulin G (IgG) on the surface of cardiomyocytes. ALL of the affected PD-1(-/-) mice exhibited high-titer circulating IgG autoantibodies reactive to a 33-kilodalton protein expressed specifically on the surface of cardiomyocytes. These results indicate that PD-1 may be an important factor contributing to the prevention of autoimmune diseases.
