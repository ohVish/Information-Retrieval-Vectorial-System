Dislocation mean free paths and strain hardening of crystals
Predicting the strain hardening properties of crystals constitutes a long- standing challenge for dislocation theory. The main difficulty resides in the integration of dislocation processes through a wide range of time and length scales, up to macroscopic dimensions. In the present multiscale approach, dislocation dynamics simulations are used to establish a dislocation- based continuum model incorporating discrete and intermittent aspects of plastic flow. This is performed through the modeling of a key quantity, the mean free path of dislocations. The model is then integrated at the scale of bulk crystals, which allows for the detailed reproduction of the complex deformation curves of face- centered cubic crystals. Because of its predictive ability, the proposed framework has a large potential for further applications.
