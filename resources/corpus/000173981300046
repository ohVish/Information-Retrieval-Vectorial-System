Array-based electrical detection of DNA with nanoparticle probes
A DNA array detection method is reported in which the binding of oligonucleotides functionalized with gold nanoparticles leads to conductivity changes associated with target-probe binding events. The binding events localize gold nanoparticles in an electrode gap; silver deposition facilitated by these nanoparticles bridges the gap and leads to readily measurable conductivity changes. An unusual salt concentration-dependent hybridization behavior associated with these nanoparticle probes was exploited to achieve selectivity without a thermal-stringency wash. Using this method, we have detected target DNA at concentrations as low as 500 femtomolar with a point mutation selectivity factor of similar to 100,000:1.
