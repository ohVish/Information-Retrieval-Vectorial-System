Resolution of distinct rotational substeps by submillisecond kinetic analysis of F-1-ATPase
The enzyme F-1-ATPase has been shown to be a rotary motor in which the central gamma -subunit rotates inside the cylinder made of alpha (3)beta (3) subunits. At low ATP concentrations, the motor rotates in discrete 120 degrees steps, consistent with sequential ATP hydrolysis on the three beta -subunits. The mechanism of stepping is unknown. Here we show by high-speed imaging that the 120 degrees step consists of roughly 90 degrees and 30 degrees substeps, each taking only a fraction of a millisecond. ATP binding drives the 90 degrees substep, and the 30 degrees substep is probably driven by release of a hydrolysis product. The two substeps are separated by two reactions of about 1 ms, which together occupy most of the ATP hydrolysis cycle. This scheme probably applies to rotation at full speed (similar to 130 revolutions per second at saturating ATP) down to occasional stepping at nanomolar ATP concentrations, and supports the binding-change model for ATP synthesis by reverse rotation of F-1-ATPase.
