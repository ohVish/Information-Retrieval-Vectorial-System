Charge-induced reversible strain in a metal
Dimension changes on the order of 0.1% or above in response to an applied voltage have been reported for many types of materials, including ceramics, polymers, and carbon nanostructures, but not, so far, for metals. We show that reversible strain amplitudes comparable to those of commercial piezoceramics can be induced in metals by introducing a continuous network of nanometersized pores with a high surface area and by controlling the surface electronic charge density through an applied potential relative to an electrolyte impregnating the pores.
