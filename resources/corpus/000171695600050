Regulation of cutaneous malignancy by gamma delta T cells
The localization of gamma delta T cells within epithelia suggests that these cells may contribute to the down-regulation of epithelial malignancies. We report that mice lacking gamma delta cells are highly susceptible to multiple regimens of cutaneous carcinogenesis. After exposure to carcinogens, skin cells expressed Rae-1 and H60, major histocompatibility complex-related molecules structurally resembling human MICA. Each of these is a ligand for NKG2d, a receptor expressed by cytolytic T cells and natural killer(NK) cells. In vitro, skin-associated NKG2d(+) gamma delta cells killed skin carcinoma cells by a mechanism that was sensitive to blocking NKG2d engagement. Thus, local T cells may use evolutionarily conserved proteins to negatively regulate malignancy.
