The crystal structure of uncomplexed actin in the ADP state
The dynamics and polarity of actin filaments are controlled by a conformational change coupled to the hydrolysis of adenosine S'-triphosphate (ATP) by a mechanism that remains to be elucidated. Actin modified to block polymerization was crystallized in the adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP) state, and the structure was solved to 1.54 angstrom resolution. Compared with previous ATP-actin structures from complexes with deoxyribonuclease I, profilin, and gelsotin, monomeric ADP-actin is characterized by a marked conformational change in subdomain 2. The successful crystallization of monomeric actin opens the way to future structure determinations of actin complexes with actin-binding proteins such as myosin.
