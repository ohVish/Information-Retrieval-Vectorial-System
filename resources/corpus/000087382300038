A monoclinic post-stishovite polymorph of silica in the Shergotty meteorite
A post-stishovite phase of silica was identified in the Shergotty meteorite by x-ray diffraction and field emission scanning electron microscopy. The diffraction pattern revealed a monoclinic Lattice, similar to the baddeleyite-structured polymorph with the cell parameters a = 4.375(1) angstroms, b = 4.584(1) angstroms, c = 4.708(1) angstroms, beta = 99.97(3), rho = 4.30(2) grams per cubic centimeter, where the numbers in parentheses are the maximum deviations. Transmission electron microscopy investigations indicate the presence of the alpha-lead dioxide-like polymorph, stishovite, and secondary cristobalite in the same silica grain. The mixture of high-density polymorphs suggests that several post-stishovite phases were formed during the shock event on the Shergotty parent body.
