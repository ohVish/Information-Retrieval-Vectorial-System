Peer effects on worker output in the laboratory generalize to the field
We compare estimates of peer effects on worker output in laboratory experiments and field studies from naturally occurring environments. The mean study-level estimate of a change in a worker's productivity in response to an increase in a co-worker's productivity (gamma) is (gamma) over cap = 0.12 (SE = 0.03, n(studies) = 34), with a between-study standard deviation tau = 0.16. The mean estimated (gamma) over cap -values are close between laboratory and field studies ((gamma) over cap (lab) - (gamma) over cap (field) = 0.04, P = 0.55, n(lab) = 11, n(field) = 23), as are estimates of between-study variance tau(2) ((tau) over cap (2)(lab) - (tau) over cap (2)(field) = -0: 003, P = 0.89). The small mean difference between laboratory and field estimates holds even after controlling for sample characteristics such as incentive schemes and work complexity ((gamma) over cap (lab) - (gamma) over cap (field) = 0.03, P = 0.62, n(samples) = 46). Laboratory experiments generalize quantitatively in that they provide an accurate description of the mean and variance of productivity spillovers.
