Heat flux anomalies in Antarctica revealed by satellite magnetic data
The geothermal heat flux is an important factor in the dynamics of ice sheets; it affects the occurrence of subglacial takes, the onset of ice streams, and mass tosses from the ice sheet base. Because direct heat flux measurements in ice-covered regions are difficult to obtain, we developed a method that uses satellite magnetic data to estimate the heat flux underneath the Antarctic ice sheet We found that the heat flux underneath the ice sheet varies from 40 to 185 megawatts per square meter and that areas of high heat flux coincide with known current volcanism and some areas known to have ice streams.
