Future lab-on-a-chip technologies for interrogating individual molecules
Advances in technology have allowed chemical sampling with high spatial resolution and the manipulation and measurement of individual molecules. Adaptation of these approaches to lab-on-a-chip formats is providing a new class of research tools for the investigation of biochemistry and life processes.
