Enhanced current transport at grain boundaries in high-T-c superconductors
Large-scale applications of high-transition-temperature (high-T-c) superconductors, such as their use in superconducting cables, are impeded by the fact that polycrystalline materials ( the only practical option) support significantly lower current densities than single crystals(1-6). The superconducting critical current density (J(c)) across a grain boundary drops exponentially if the misorientation angle exceeds 2 degrees- 7 degrees. Grain texturing reduces the average misorientation angle, but problems persist(7,8). Adding impurities ( such as Ca in YBa2Cu3O7-delta; YBCO) leads to increased J(c) (refs 9, 10), which is generally attributed to excess holes introduced by Ca2+ substituting for Y3+ (ref. 11). However, a comprehensive physical model for the role of grain boundaries and Ca doping has remained elusive. Here we report calculations, imaging and spectroscopy at the atomic scale that demonstrate that in poly-crystalline YBCO, highly strained grain-boundary regions contain excess O vacancies, which reduce the local hole concentration. The Ca impurities indeed substitute for Y, but in grain-boundary regions under compression and tension they also replace Ba and Cu, relieving strain and suppressing O-vacancy formation. Our results demonstrate that the ionic radii are more important than their electronic valences for enhancing J(c).
