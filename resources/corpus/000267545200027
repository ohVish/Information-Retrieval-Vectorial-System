Elite and stochastic models for induced pluripotent stem cell generation
Induced pluripotent stem cells offer unprecedented potential for disease research, drug screening, toxicology and regenerative medicine. However, the process of reprogramming is inefficient and often incomplete. Here I consider reasons for bottlenecks in induced pluripotent stem cell generation, and propose a model in which most or all cells have the potential to become pluripotent.
