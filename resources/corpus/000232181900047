The global reach of the 26 December 2004 Sumatra tsunami
Numerical model simulations, combined with tide-gauge and satellite altimetry data, reveal that wave amplitudes, directionatity, and global propagation patterns of the 26 December 2004 Sumatra tsunami were primarily determined by the orientation and intensity of the offshore seismic line source and subsequently by the trapping effect of mid-ocean ridge topographic waveguides.
