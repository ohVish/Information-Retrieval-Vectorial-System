Enhanced dendritic cell antigen capture via toll-like receptor-induced actin remodeling
Microbial products are sensed through Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and trigger a program of dendritic cell (DC) maturation that enables DCs to activate T cells. Although an accepted hallmark of this response is eventual down-regulation of DC endocytic capacity, we show that TLR ligands first acutely stimulate antigen macropinocytosis, leading to enhanced presentation on class I and class 11 major histocompatibility complex molecules. Simultaneously, actin-rich podosomes disappear, which suggests a coordinated redeployment of actin to fuel endocytosis. These reciprocal changes are transient and require p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation. Thus, the DC actin cytoskeleton can be rapidly mobilized in response to innate immune stimuli to enhance antigen capture and presentation.
