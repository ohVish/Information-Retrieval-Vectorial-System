A decade's perspective on DNA sequencing technology
The decade since the Human Genome Project ended has witnessed a remarkable sequencing technology explosion that has permitted a multitude of questions about the genome to be asked and answered, at unprecedented speed and resolution. Here I present examples of how the resulting information has both enhanced our knowledge and expanded the impact of the genome on biomedical research. New sequencing technologies have also introduced exciting new areas of biological endeavour. The continuing upward trajectory of sequencing technology development is enabling clinical applications that are aimed at improving medical diagnosis and treatment.
