Bidirectional plasticity in fast-spiking GABA circuits by visual experience
Experience-dependent plasticity in the brain requires balanced
excitation-inhibition1. How individual circuit elements contribute
to plasticity outcome in complex neocortical networks remains
unknown. Here we report an intracellular analysis of ocular dominance
plasticity-the loss of acuity and cortical responsiveness for
an eye deprived of vision in early life2,3. Unlike the typical progressive
loss of pyramidal-cell bias, direct recording from fast-spiking
cells in vivo reveals a counterintuitive initial shift towards the
occluded eye followed by a late preference for the open eye, consistent
with a spike-timing-dependent plasticity rule for these inhibitory
neurons. Intracellular pharmacology confirms a dynamic
switch of GABA (c-aminobutyric acid) impact to pyramidal cells
following deprivation in juvenile mice only. Together these results
suggest that the bidirectional recruitment of an initially binocular
GABA circuit may contribute to experience-dependent plasticity in
the developing visual cortex.
