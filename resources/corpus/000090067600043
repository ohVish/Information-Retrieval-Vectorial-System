Forster energy transfer in an optical microcavity
By studying the transfer of excitation energy between dye molecules confined within an optical microcavity, we demonstrate experimentally that Forster energy transfer is influenced by the Local photonic mode density. Locating donor and acceptor molecules at well-defined positions allows the transfer rate to be determined as a function of both mutual separation and cavity Length. The results show that the Forster transfer rate depends Linearly on the donor emission rate and hence photonic mode density, providing the potential to control energy transfer by modification of the optical environment.
