An Arabidopsis circadian clock component interacts with both CRY1 and phyB
Most organisms, from cyanobacteria to mammals, use circadian clocks to coordinate their activities with the natural 24-h light/dark cycle. The clock proteins of Drosophila and mammals exhibit striking homology but do not show similarity with clock proteins found so far from either cyanobacteria or Neurospora(1,2). Each of these organisms uses a transcriptionally regulated negative feedback loop in which the messenger RNA levels of the clock components cycle over a 24-h period. Proteins containing PAS domains are invariably found in at least one component of the characterized eukaryotic clocks(1). Here we describe ADAGIO1 (ADO1), a gene of Arabidopsis thaliana that encodes a protein containing a PAS domain. We found that a loss-of-function ado1 mutant is altered in both gene expression and cotyledon movement in circadian rhythmicity. Under constant white or blue light, the ado1 mutant exhibits a longer period than that of wild-type Arabidopsis seedlings, whereas under red light cotyledon movement and stem elongation are arrhythmic. Both yeast two-hybrid and in vitro binding studies show that there is a physical interaction between ADO1 and the photoreceptors CRY1 and phyB. We propose that ADO1 is an important component of the Arabidopsis circadian system.
