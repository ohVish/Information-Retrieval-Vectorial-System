The response of two contrasting limestone grasslands to simulated climate change
Two different UK limestone grasslands were exposed to simulated climate change with the use of nonintrusive techniques to manipulate Local climate over 5 years. Resistance to climate change, defined as the ability of a community to maintain its composition and biomass in response to environmental stress, could be explained by reference to the functional composition and successional status of the grasslands. The more fertile, early-successional grassland was much more responsive to climate change. Resistance could not be explained by the particular climates experienced by the two grasslands. Productive, disturbed Landscapes created by modern human activity may prove more vulnerable to climate change than older, traditional Landscapes.
