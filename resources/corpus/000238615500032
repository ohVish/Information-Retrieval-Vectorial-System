Nuclear reprogramming and pluripotency
The cloning of mammals from differentiated donor cells has refuted the old dogma that development is an irreversible process. It has demonstrated that the oocyte can reprogramme an adult nucleus into an embryonic state that can direct development of a new organism. The prospect of deriving patient-specific embryonic stem cells by nuclear transfer underscores the potential use of this technology in regenerative medicine. The future challenge will be to study alternatives to nuclear transfer in order to recapitulate reprogramming in a Petri dish without the use of oocytes.
