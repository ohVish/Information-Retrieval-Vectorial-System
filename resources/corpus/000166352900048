Categorical representation of visual stimuli in the primate prefrontal cortex
The ability to group stimuli into meaningful categories is a fundamental cognitive process. To explore its neural basis. we trained monkeys to categorize computer-generated stimuli as "cats" and "dogs." A morphing system was used to systematically vary stimulus shape and precisely define the category boundary. Neural activity in the Lateral prefrontal cortex reflected the category of visual stimuli, even when a monkey was retrained with the stimuli assigned to new categories.
