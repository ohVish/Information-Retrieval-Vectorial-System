Trophic cascades in a formerly cod-dominated ecosystem
Removal of top predators from ecosystems can result in cascading effects through the trophic levels below, completely restructuring the food Web. Cascades have been observed in small-scale or simple food webs, but not in large, complex, open-ocean ecosystems. Using data spanning many decades from a once cod-dominated northwest Atlantic ecosystem, we demonstrate a trophic cascade in a large marine ecosystem. Several cod stocks in other geographic areas have also collapsed without recovery, suggesting the existence of trophic cascades in these systems.
