Naive and memory CD4(+) T cell survival controlled by clonal abundance
Immunity to a plethora of microbes depends on a diverse repertoire of naive lymphocytes and the production of long-lived memory cells. We present evidence here that low clonal abundance in a polyclonal repertoire favors the survival and activation of naive CD4(+) T cells as well as the survival of their memory cell progeny. The inverse relation between clonal frequency and survival suggests that intraclonal competition could help maintain an optimally diverse repertoire of T cells and an optimal environment for the generation of long-lived memory cells.
