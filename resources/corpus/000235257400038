New neurons follow the flow of cerebrospinal fluid in the adult brain
In the adult brain, neuroblasts born in the subventricular zone migrate from the watts of the lateral ventricles to the olfactory bulb. How do these cells orient over such a tong distance and through complex territories? Here we show that neuroblast migration parallels cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow. Beating of ependymal cilia is required for normal CSF flow, concentration gradient formation of CSF guidance molecules, and directional migration of neuroblasts. Results suggest that polarized epithelial. cells contribute important vectorial information-for guidance of young, migrating neurons.
