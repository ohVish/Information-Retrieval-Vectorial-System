Synthesis and Structure Determination of the Hierarchical Meso-Microporous Zeolite ITQ-43
The formation of mesopores in microporous zeolites is generally performed by postsynthesis acid, basic, and steam treatments. The hierarchical pore systems thus formed allow better adsorption, diffusion, and reactivity of these materials. By combining organic and inorganic structure-directing agents and high-throughput methodologies, we were able to synthesize a zeolite with a hierarchical system of micropores and mesopores, with channel openings delimited by 28 tetrahedral atoms. Its complex crystalline structure was solved with the use of automated diffraction tomography.
