Requirement for ROR gamma in thymocyte survival and lymphoid organ development
Most developing thymocytes undergo apoptosis because they cannot interact productively with molecules encoded by the major histocompatibility complex. Here, we show that mice lacking the orphan nuclear hormone receptor ROR gamma lose thymic expression of the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-xL. ROR gamma thus regulates the survival of CD4(+)8(+) thymocytes and may control the temporal window during which thymocytes can undergo positive selection. ROR gamma was also required for development of lymph nodes and Peyer's patches, but not splenic follicles, In its absence, there was loss of a population of CD3(-)CD4(+)CD45(+) cells that normally express ROR gamma and that are Likely early progenitors of lymphoid organs. Hence, ROR gamma has critical functions in T cell repertoire selection and Lymphoid organogenesis.
