Room-temperature enantioselective C-H iodination via kinetic resolution
Asymmetric carbon-hydrogen (C-H) activation reactions often rely on desymmetrization of prochiral C-H bonds on the same achiral molecule, using a chiral catalyst. Here, we report a kinetic resolution via palladium-catalyzed enantioselective C-H iodination in which one of the enantiomers of a racemic benzylic amine substrates undergoes faster aryl C-H insertion with the chiral catalysts than the other. The resulting enantioenriched C-H functionalization products would not be accessible through desymmetrization of prochiral C-H bonds. The exceedingly high relative rate ratio (k(fast)/k(slow) up to 244), coupled with the subsequent iodination of the remaining enantiomerically enriched starting material using a chiral ligand with the opposite configuration, enables conversion of both substrate enantiomers into enantiomerically pure iodinated products.
