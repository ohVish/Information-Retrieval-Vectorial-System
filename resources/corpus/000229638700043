Release of volatiles from a possible cryovolcano from near-infrared imaging of Titan
Titan is the only satellite in our Solar System with a dense atmosphere. The surface pressure is 1.5 bar ( ref. 1) and, similar to the Earth, N-2 is the main component of the atmosphere. Methane is the second most important component(2), but it is photodissociated on a timescale of 10(7) years ( ref. 3). This short timescale has led to the suggestion that Titan may possess a surface or subsurface reservoir of hydrocarbons(4,5) to replenish the atmosphere. Here we report near-infrared images of Titan obtained on 26 October 2004 by the Cassini spacecraft. The images show that a widespread methane ocean does not exist; subtle albedo variations instead suggest topographical variations, as would be expected for a more solid ( perhaps icy) surface. We also find a circular structure similar to 30 km in diameter that does not resemble any features seen on other icy satellites. We propose that the structure is a dome formed by upwelling icy plumes that release methane into Titan's atmosphere.
