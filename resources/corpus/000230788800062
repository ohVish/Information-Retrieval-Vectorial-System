Action potential refractory period in ureter smooth muscle is set by Ca sparks and BK channels
In excitable tissues the refractory period is a critical control mechanism preventing hyperactivity and undesirable tetani, by preventing subsequent stimuli eliciting action potentials and Ca2+ entry. In ureteric smooth muscle, peristaltic waves that occur as invading pacemaker potentials produce long-lasting action potentials (300-800 ms) and extraordinarily long ( more than 10 s) refractory periods(1-6), which prevent urine reflux and kidney damage(2). For smooth muscles neither the mechanisms underlying the refractory period nor the link between excitability and refractoriness are properly understood. Here we show that a negative feedback process, which depends on Ca2+ loading the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) during the action potential and on the subsequent activation of local releases of Ca2+ from the SR (sparks(7)), stimulating plasmalemmal Ca2+-sensitive K+ (BK) channels, determines the refractory period of the action potential. As sparks gradually reduce the Ca2+ load in the SR, electrical inhibition is released, the refractory period is terminated and peristaltic contractions occur again. The refractory period can be manipulated, for example from 10 s to 100 s, by altering the Ca2+ content of the SR or release mechanism or by inhibiting BK channels. This insight into the control of excitability and hence function provides a focus for therapies directed at pathologies of smooth muscle.
