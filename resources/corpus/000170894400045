Allele-specific receptor-ligand interactions in Brassica self-incompatibility
Genetic self-incompatibility in Brassica is determined by alleles of the transmembrane serine-threonine kinase SRK, which functions in the stigma epidermis, and of the cysteine-rich peptide SCR, which functions in pollen. Using tagged versions of SRK and SCR as well as endogenous stigma and pollen proteins, we show that SCR binds the SRK ectodomain and that this binding is allele,specific. Thus, SRK and SCR function as a receptor-Ligand pair in the recognition of self pollen. Specificity in the self-incompatibility response derives from allele-specific formation of SRK-SCR complexes at the pollen-stigma interface.
