Function and Molecular Mechanism of Acetylation in Autophagy Regulation
Protein acetylation emerged as a key regulatory mechanism for many cellular processes. We used genetic analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to identify Esa1 as a histone acetyltransferase required for autophagy. We further identified the autophagy signaling component Atg3 as a substrate for Esa1. Specifically, acetylation of K19 and K48 of Atg3 regulated autophagy by controlling Atg3 and Atg8 interaction and lipidation of Atg8. Starvation induced transient K19-K48 acetylation through spatial and temporal regulation of the localization of acetylase Esa1 and the deacetylase Rpd3 on pre-autophagosomal structures (PASs) and their interaction with Atg3. Attenuation of K19-K48 acetylation was associated with attenuation of autophagy. Increased K19-K48 acetylation after deletion of the deacetylase Rpd3 caused increased autophagy. Thus, protein acetylation contributes to control of autophagy.
