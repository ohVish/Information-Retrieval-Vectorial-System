A runaway collision in a young star cluster as the origin of the brightest supernova
Supernova SN 2006gy in the galaxy NGC1260 is the most luminous recorded(1-4). Its progenitor might have been a very massive (>100M(circle dot), where M-circle dot is the mass of the Sun) star(5), but that interpretation is incompatible with hydrogen in the spectrum of the supernova; stars>40M(circle dot) are believed to have shed their hydrogen envelopes several hundred thousand years before the explosion(6). Alternatively, the progenitor might have arisen from the merger of two massive stars(7). Here we show that the collision frequency of massive stars in a dense and young cluster (of the kind to be expected near the centre of a galaxy) is sufficient to provide a reasonable chance that SN 2006gy resulted from such a bombardment. If this is the correct explanation, then we predict that when the supernova fades (in a year or so) a dense cluster of massive stars will become visible at the site of the explosion.
