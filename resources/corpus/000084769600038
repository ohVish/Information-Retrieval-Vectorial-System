Regulation of abscisic acid-induced stomatal closure and anion channels by guard cell AAPK kinase
Abscisic acid (ABA) stimulates stomatal closure and thus supports water conservation by plants during drought. Mass spectrometry-generated peptide sequence information was used to clone a Vicia faba complementary DNA, AAPK, encoding a guard cell-specific ABA-activated serine-threonine protein kinase.(AAPK). Expression in transformed guard cells of AAPK altered by one amino acid (lysine 43 to alanine 43) renders stomata insensitive to ABA-induced closure by eliminating ABA activation of plasma membrane anion channels. This information should allow cell-specific, targeted biotechnological manipulation of crop water status.
