From micro- to nanofabrication with soft materials
Soft materials are finding applications in areas ranging from microfluidic device technology to nanofabrication. We review recent work in these areas, discuss the motivation for device fabrication with soft materials, and describe applications of soft materials. In particular. we discuss active microfluidic devices for cell sorting and biochemical assays, replication-molded optics with subdiffraction limit features, and nanometer-scale resonators and wires formed from single-molecule DNA templates as examples of how the special properties of soft materials address outstanding problems in device fabrication.
