Extra-large-pore zeolites with two-dimensional channels formed by 14 and 12 rings
Stable zeolites that have larger pore apertures and a three-dimensional pore topology are of interest because they could be used to adsorb larger molecules, particularly for application in oil re. ning. Several large-pore zeolitic materials with channels formed by openings of more than 12 rings are known, but all of them have a one-dimensional channel system that limits their use in catalysis. We report the synthesis and some characterizations of IM-12, a thermally stable germanium-containing zeolite that contains the first two-dimensional channel system with extra-large pores formed by 14- and 12-ring channels.
