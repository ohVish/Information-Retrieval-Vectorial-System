Spatiotemporal addressing of surface activity
We have modified surface catalytic activity in real time and space by focusing an addressable laser beam to differentially heat a platinum (110) single-crystal surface. Ellipsomicroscopy imaging of local conditions (such as reactant and product local coverages) enabled us to close the loop between sensing and actuation (both spatiotemporally resolved). Pulses and fronts, the basic building blocks of patterns, could be formed, accelerated, modified, guided, and destroyed at will. Real-time image processing and feedback allow the design and implementation of new classes of nonlocal evolution rules.
