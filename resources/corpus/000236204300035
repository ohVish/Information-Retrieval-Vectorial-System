Microheterogeneity of singlet oxygen distributions in irradiated humic acid solutions
Singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) is a highly reactive species formed through solar irradiation of organic matter in environmental waters. Implicated in a range of reactions, it has proven difficult to quantify its spatial distribution in natural waters. We assessed the microheterogeneous distribution of O-1(2) in irradiated solutions containing chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) by using molecular probes of varying hydrophobicity. The apparent O-1(2) concentrations ([O-1(2)](app)), measured by recently developed hydrophobic trap-and-trigger chemiluminescent probe molecules, were orders of magnitude higher than those measured by the conventional hydrophilic probe molecule furfuryl alcohol. The differential [O-1(2)](app) values measured by these probes reflect a steep concentration gradient between the CDOM macromolecules and the aqueous phase. A detailed kinetic model based on the data predicts probabilistic O-1(2) distributions under different solvent conditions.
