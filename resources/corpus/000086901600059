Structural insights into the stereochemistry of the cyclooxygenase reaction
Cyclooxygenases are bifunctional enzymes that catalyse the first committed step in the synthesis of prostaglandins, thromboxanes and other eicosanoids(1-3). The two known cyclooxygenases isoforms share a high degree of amino-acid sequence similarity(1-4), structural topology(5-7) and an identical catalytic mechanism(1-3). Cyclooxygenase enzymes catalyse two sequential reactions in spatially distinct, but mechanistically coupled active sites(8-11). The initial cyclooxygenase reaction converts arachidonic acid (which is achiral) to prostaglandin G(2) (which has five chiral centres). The subsequent peroxidase reaction reduces prostaglandin G(2) to prostaglandin H-2. Here we report the co-crystal structures of murine apo-cyclooxygenase-2 in complex with arachidonic acid and prostaglandin. These structures suggest the molecular basis for the stereospecificity of prostaglandin G(2) synthesis.
