Reversible Reactions of Ethylene with Distannynes Under Ambient Conditions
Ethylene's cycloadditions to unsaturated hydrocarbons occupy well-established ground in classical organic chemistry. In contrast, its reactivity toward alkene and alkyne analogs of carbon's heavier-element congeners silicon, germanium, tin, or lead has been little explored. We show here that treatment of the distannynes Ar(iPr4)SnSnAr(iPr4) [Ar(iPr4) = C(6)H(3)-2,6(C(6)H(3)-2,6-(i)Pr(2))(2), 1] or Ar(iPr8)SnSnAr(iPr8) [Ar(iPr8) = C(6)H-2,6(C(6)H(2)-2,4,6-(i)Pr(3))(2)-3,5-(i)Pr(2), 2] with ethylene under ambient conditions affords the cycloadducts Ar(iPr4)Sn(mu(2):eta(1):eta(1)-C(2)H(4))(2)SnAr(iPr4) (3) or Ar(iPr8)Sn(mu(2):eta(1):eta(1)-C(2)H(4))(2)SnAr(iPr8) (4) that were structurally and spectroscopically characterized. Ethylene incorporation in 3 and 4 involves tin-carbon sigma bonding and is shown to be fully reversible under ambient conditions; hydrocarbon solutions of 3 or 4 revert to the distannynes 1 or 2 with ethylene elimination under reduced pressure or upon standing at similar to 25 degrees C. Variable-temperature proton nuclear magnetic resonance studies showed that the enthalpies of reaction were near -48 (3) and -27 (4) kilojoules per mole.
