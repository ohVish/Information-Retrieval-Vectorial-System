Distinct catalytic and non-catalytic roles of ARGONAUTE4 in RNA-directed DNA methylation
DNA methylation has important functions in stable, transcriptional gene silencing, immobilization of transposable elements and genome organization(1). In Arabidopsis, DNA methylation can be induced by double-stranded RNA through the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, a response known as RNA-directed DNA methylation(2). This requires a specialized set of RNAi components, including ARGONAUTE4 (AGO4)(3-6). Here we show that AGO4 binds to small RNAs including small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) originating from transposable and repetitive elements, and cleaves target RNA transcripts. Single mutations in the Asp-Asp-His catalytic motif of AGO4 do not affect siRNA-binding activity but abolish its catalytic potential. siRNA accumulation and non-CpG DNA methylation at some loci require the catalytic activity of AGO4, whereas others are less dependent on this activity. Our results are consistent with a model in which AGO4 can function at target loci through two distinct and separable mechanisms. First, AGO4 can recruit components that signal DNA methylation in a manner independent of its catalytic activity. Second, AGO4 catalytic activity can be crucial for the generation of secondary siRNAs that reinforce its repressive effects.
