Single-file diffusion of colloids in one-dimensional channels
Single-file diffusion, prevalent in many processes, refers to the restricted motion of interacting particles in narrow micropores with the mutual passage excluded. A single-filing system was developed by confining colloidal spheres in one-dimensional circular channels of micrometer scale. Optical video microscopy study shows evidence that the particle self-diffusion is non-Fickian for long periods of time. In particular, the distribution of particle displacement is a Gaussian function.
