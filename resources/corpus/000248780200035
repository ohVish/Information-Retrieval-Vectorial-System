Deep ultraviolet light-emitting hexagonal boron nitride synthesized at atmospheric pressure
Materials emitting light in the deep ultraviolet region around 200 nanometers are essential in a wide-range of applications, such as information storage technology, environmental protection, and medical treatment. Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), which was recently found to be a promising deep ultraviolet light emitter, has traditionally been synthesized under high pressure and at high temperature. We successfully synthesized high-purity hBN crystals at atmospheric pressure by using a nickel-molybdenum solvent. The obtained hBN crystals emitted intense 215-nanometer luminescence at room temperature. This study demonstrates an easier way to grow high-quality hBN crystals, through their liquid-phase deposition on a substrate at atmospheric pressure.
