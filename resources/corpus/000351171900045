A human tRNA synthetase is a potent PARP1-activating effector target for resveratrol
Resveratrol is reported to extend lifespan(1,2) and provide cardioneuro-protective(3), anti-diabetic(4), and anti-cancer effects(3,5) by initiating a stress response(2) that induces survival genes. Because human tyrosyl transfer-RNA(tRNA) synthetase (TyrRS) translocates to the nucleus under stress conditions(6), we considered the possibility that the tyrosine-like phenolic ring of resveratrol might fit into the active site pocket to effect a nuclear role. Here we present a 2.1 angstrom co-crystal structure of resveratrol bound to the active site of TyrRS. Resveratrol nullifies the catalytic activity and redirects TyrRS to a nuclear function, stimulating NAD(+)-dependent auto-poly-ADP-ribosylation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1). Downstream activation of key stress signalling pathways are causally connected to TyrRS-PARP1-NAD(+) collaboration. This collaborationis also demonstrated in the mouse, and is specifically blocked in vivo by a resveratrol-displacing tyrosyl adenylate analogue. In contrast to functionally diverse tRNA synthetase catalytic nulls created by alternative splicing events that ablate active sites(7), here a non-spliced TyrRS catalytic null reveals a new PARP1- and NAD(+)-dependent dimension to the physiological mechanism of resveratrol.
