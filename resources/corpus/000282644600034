Tau Reduction Prevents A beta-Induced Defects in Axonal Transport
Amyloid-beta (A beta) peptides, derived from the amyloid precursor protein, and the microtubule-associated protein tau are key pathogenic factors in Alzheimer's disease (AD). How exactly they impair cognitive functions is unknown. We assessed the effects of A beta and tau on axonal transport of mitochondria and the neurotrophin receptor TrkA, cargoes that are critical for neuronal function and survival and whose distributions are altered in AD. A beta oligomers rapidly inhibited axonal transport of these cargoes in wild-type neurons. Lowering tau levels prevented these defects without affecting baseline axonal transport. Thus, A beta requires tau to impair axonal transport, and tau reduction protects against A beta-induced axonal transport defects.
