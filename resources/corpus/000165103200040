Observation of X-ray lines from a gamma-ray burst (GRB991216): Evidence of moving ejecta from the progenitor
We report on the discovery of two emission features observed in the x-ray spectrum of the afterglow of the gamma-ray burst (GRB) of 16 December 1999 by the Chandra X-ray Observatory. These features are identified with the Ly(alpha), Line and the narrow recombination continuum by hydrogenic ions of iron at a redshift z = 1.00 +/- 0.02, providing an unambiguous measurement of the distance of a GRB. Line width and intensity imply that the progenitor of the GRB was a massive star system that ejected, before the GRB event, a quantity of iron similar to0.01 of the mass of the sun at a velocity similar to0.1 of the speed of light, probably by a supernova explosion.
