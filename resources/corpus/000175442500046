Large-scale transcriptional activity in chromosomes 21 and 22
The sequences of the human chromosomes 21 and 22 indicate that there are approximately 770 well-characterized and predicted genes. In this study, empirically derived maps identifying active areas of RNA transcription on these chromosomes have been constructed with the use of cytosolic polyadenylated RNA obtained from 11 human cell lines. Oligonucleotide arrays containing probes spaced on average every 35 base pairs along these chromosomes were used. When compared with the sequence annotations available for these chromosomes, it is noted that as much as an order of magnitude more of the genomic sequence is transcribed than accounted for by the predicted and characterized exons.
