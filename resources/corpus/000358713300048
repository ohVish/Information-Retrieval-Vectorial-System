Strange metal without magnetic criticality
A fundamental challenge to our current understanding of metals is the observation of qualitative departures from Fermi liquid behavior. The standard view attributes such non-Fermi liquid phenomena to the scattering of electrons off quantum critical fluctuations of an underlying order parameter. Although the possibility of non-Fermi liquid behavior isolated from the border of magnetism has long been speculated, no experimental confirmation has been made. Here, we report on the observation of a strange metal region away from a magnetic instability in an ultrapure single crystal. In particular, we show that the heavy-fermion superconductor beta-YbAlB4 forms a possible phase with strange metallic behavior across an extensive pressure regime, distinctly separated from a high-pressure magnetic quantum phase transition by a Fermi liquid phase.
