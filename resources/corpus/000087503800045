A nanoplotter with both parallel and serial writing capabilities
The development of an eight-pen nanoplotter capable of doing parallel dip-pen nanolithography (DPN) is reported. Because line width and patterning speed in DPN are independent of contact force, only one of the tips in the parallel writing mode (the "imaging" tip) has a feedback system to monitor tip position and to write the pattern; all other tips reproduce what occurs at the imaging tip in a passive fashion. Proof-of-concept experiments that demonstrate eight-pen parallel writing, ink and rinsing wells, and "molecular corralling" via a nanoplotter-generated structure are reported.
