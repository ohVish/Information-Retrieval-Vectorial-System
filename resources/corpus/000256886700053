Bora and the kinase Aurora A cooperatively activate the kinase Plk1 and control mitotic entry
A central question in the study of cell proliferation is, what controls cell- cycle transitions? Although the accumulation of mitotic cyclins drives the transition from the G(2) phase to the M phase in embryonic cells, the trigger for mitotic entry in somatic cells remains unknown. We report that the synergistic action of Bora and the kinase Aurora A ( Aur- A) controls the G(2)- M transition. Bora accumulates in the G(2) phase and promotes Aur- A- mediated activation of Polo- like kinase 1 ( Plk1), leading to the activation of cyclin- dependent kinase 1 and mitotic entry. Mechanistically, Bora interacts with Plk1 and controls the accessibility of its activation loop for phosphorylation and activation by Aur- A. Thus, Bora and Aur- A control mitotic entry, which provides a mechanism for one of the most important yet ill- defined events in the cell cycle.
