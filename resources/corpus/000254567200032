The cancer biomarker problem
Genomic technologies offer the promise of a comprehensive understanding of cancer. These technologies are being used to characterize tumours at the molecular level, and several clinical successes have shown that such information can guide the design of drugs targeted to a relevant molecule. One of the main barriers to further progress is identifying the biological indicators, or biomarkers, of cancer that predict who will benefit from a particular targeted therapy.
