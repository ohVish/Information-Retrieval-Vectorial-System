Catalytic conversion of nitrogen to ammonia by an iron model complex
The reduction of nitrogen (N-2) to ammonia (NH3) is a requisite transformation for life(1). Although it is widely appreciated that the iron-rich cofactors of nitrogenase enzymes facilitate this transformation(2-5), how they do so remains poorly understood. A central element of debate has been the exact site or sites of N-2 coordination and reduction(6,7). In synthetic inorganic chemistry, an early emphasis was placed on molybdenum(8) because it was thought to be an essential element of nitrogenases(3) and because it had been established that well-defined molybdenum model complexes could mediate the stoichiometric conversion of N-2 to NH3 (ref. 9). This chemical transformation can be performed in a catalytic fashion by two well-defined molecular systems that feature molybdenum centres(10,11). However, it is now thought that iron is the only transition metal essential to all nitrogenases(3), and recent biochemical and spectroscopic data have implicated iron instead of molybdenum as the site of N-2 binding in the FeMo-cofactor(12). Here we describe a tris(phosphine) borane-supported iron complex that catalyses the reduction of N-2 to NH3 under mild conditions, and in which more than 40 per cent of the proton and reducing equivalents are delivered to N-2. Our results indicate that a single iron site may be capable of stabilizing the various NxHy intermediates generated during catalytic NH3 formation. Geometric tunability at iron imparted by a flexible iron-boron interaction in our model system seems to be important for efficient catalysis(13-15). We propose that the interstitial carbon atom recently assigned in the nitrogenase cofactor may have a similar role(16,17), perhaps by enabling a single iron site to mediate the enzymatic catalysis through a flexible iron-carbon interaction(18).
