Observation of five-fold local symmetry in liquid lead
The local point symmetry of the short-range order in simple monatomic liquids remains a fundamental open question in condensed-matter science. For more than 40 years it has been conjectured(1-4) that liquids with centrosymmetric interactions may be composed of icosahedral building blocks. But these proposed mobile, randomly orientated structures have remained experimentally inaccessible owing to the unavoidable averaging involved in scattering experiments, which can therefore determine only the isotropic radial distribution function. Here we overcome this limitation by capturing liquid fragments at a solid-liquid interface, and observing the scattering of totally internally reflected (evanescent) X-rays, which are sensitive only to the liquid structure at the interface. Using this method, we observe five-fold local symmetry in liquid lead adjacent to a silicon wall, and obtain an experimental portrait of the icosahedral fragments that are predicted to occur in all close-packed monatomic liquids. By shedding new light on local bond order in disordered structures such as liquids and glasses, these results should lead to a better microscopic understanding of melting, freezing and supercooling.
