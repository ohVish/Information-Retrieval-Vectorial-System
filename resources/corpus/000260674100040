Global Protein Stability Profiling in Mammalian Cells
The abundance of cellular proteins is determined largely by the rate of transcription and translation coupled with the stability of individual proteins. Although we know a great deal about global transcript abundance, little is known about global protein stability. We present a highly parallel multiplexing strategy to monitor protein turnover on a global scale by coupling flow cytometry with microarray technology to track the stability of individual proteins within a complex mixture. We demonstrated the feasibility of this approach by measuring the stability of similar to 8000 human proteins and identifying proteasome substrates. The technology provides a general platform for proteome- scale analysis of protein turnover under various physiological and disease conditions.
