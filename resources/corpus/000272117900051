A High-Resolution Structure of the Pre-microRNA Nuclear Export Machinery
Nuclear export of microRNAs (miRNAs) by exportin-5 (Exp-5) is an essential step in miRNA biogenesis. Here, we present the 2.9 angstrom structure of the pre-miRNA nuclear export machinery formed by pre-miRNA complexed with Exp-5 and a guanine triphosphate (GTP)-bound form of the small nuclear guanine triphosphatase (GTPase) Ran (RanGTP). The x-ray structure shows that Exp-5: RanGTP recognizes the 2-nucleotide 3' overhang structure and the double-stranded stem of the pre-miRNA. Exp-5: RanGTP shields the pre-miRNA stem from degradation in a baseball mitt-like structure where it is held by broadly distributed weak interactions, whereas a tunnel-like structure of Exp-5 interacts strongly with the 2-nucleotide 3' overhang through hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions. RNA recognition by Exp-5: RanGTP does not depend on RNA sequence, implying that Exp-5: RanGTP can recognize a variety of pre-miRNAs.
