Spontaneous Bose coherence of excitons and polaritons
In the past decade, there has been an increasing number of experiments on spontaneous Bose coherence of excitons and polaritons. Four major areas of research are reviewed here: three-dimensional excitons in the bulk semiconductor Cu(2)O, two-dimensional excitons in coupled quantum wells, Coulomb drag experiments in coupled two-dimensional electron gases, and polaritons in semiconductor microcavities. The unifying theory of all these experiments is the effect of spontaneous symmetry breaking in the Bose-Einstein condensation phase transition.
