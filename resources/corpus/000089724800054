Regulation of STAT3 by direct binding to the Rac1 GTPase
The signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) transcription factors become phosphorylated on tyrosine and translocate to the nucleus after stimulation of cells with growth factors or cytokines. We show that the Rad guanosine triphosphatase can bind to and regulate STAT3 activity. Dominant negative Rad inhibited STAT3 activation by growth factors, whereas activated Rad stimulated STAT3 phosphorylation on both tyrosine and serine residues. Moreover, activated Rad formed a complex with STAT3 in mammalian cells, Yeast two-hybrid analysis indicated that STAT3 binds directly to active but not inactive Rad and that the interaction occurs via the effector domain. Rad may serve as an alternate mechanism for targeting STAT3 to tyrosine kinase signaling complexes.
