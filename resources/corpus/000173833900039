Observation of stimulated emission by direct three-photon excitation
Multiphoton processes, predicted(1) theoretically in 1931, were for a long time considered to be mainly of academic interest. This view changed when it was shown(2,3) that a two-photon absorption process could, because of a quadratic dependence of excitation on intensity, produce a spatially confined excitation useful for three-dimensional data storage and imaging. Two-photon absorption has received considerable attention recently because of the development of highly efficient two-photon-sensitive materials, leading to numerous technological applications(4-28). These successes have created interest in exploring applications based on three-photon excitations(29). For a three-photon process, a longer excitation wavelength such as those common in optical communications can be used. Also, the cubic dependence of the three-photon process on the input light intensity provides a stronger spatial confinement, so that a higher contrast in imaging can be obtained. Here we report the observation of a highly directional and up-converted stimulated emission as an amplified spontaneous emission, produced in an organic chromophore solution by a strong simultaneous three-photon absorption at 1.3 mum. This achievement suggests opportunities for a three-photon process in frequency-upconversion lasing, short-pulse optical communications, and the emerging field of biophotonics.
