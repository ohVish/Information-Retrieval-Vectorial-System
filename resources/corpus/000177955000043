Potential regulatory function of human dendritic cells expressing indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase
Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) can induce tolerance or immunity. We describe a subset of human APCs that express indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and inhibit T cell proliferation in vitro. IDO-positive APCs constituted a discrete subset identified by coexpression of the cell-surface markers CD123 and CCR6. In the dendritic cell (DC) lineage, IDO-mediated suppressor activity was present in fully mature as well as immature CD123(+) DCs. IDO+ DCs could also be readily detected in vivo, which suggests that these cells may represent a regulatory subset of APCs in humans.
