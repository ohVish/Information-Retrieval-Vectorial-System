Negligible glacial-interglacial variation in continental chemical weathering rates
Chemical weathering of the continents is central to the regulation of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, and hence global climate(1,2). On million-year timescales silicate weathering leads to the draw-down of carbon dioxide(1), and on millennial timescales chemical weathering affects the calcium carbonate saturation state of the oceans and hence their uptake of carbon dioxide(2). However, variations in chemical weathering rates over glacial - interglacial cycles remain uncertain. During glacial periods, cold and dry conditions reduce the rate of chemical weathering(3), but intense physical weathering(3,4) and the exposure of carbonates on continental shelves due to low sea levels(5,6) may increase this rate. Here we present high-resolution records of the lead isotope composition of ferromanganese crusts from the North Atlantic Ocean that cover the past 550,000 years. Combining these records with a simple quantitative model of changes in the lead isotope composition of the deep North Atlantic Ocean in response to chemical weathering, we find that chemical weathering rates were two to three times lower in the glaciated interior of the North Atlantic Region during glacial periods than during the intervening interglacial periods. This decrease roughly balances the increase in chemical weathering caused by the exposure of continental shelves, indicating that chemical weathering rates remained relatively constant on glacial - interglacial timescales. On timescales of more than a million years, however, we suggest that enhanced weathering of silicate glacial sediments during interglacial periods results in a net draw-down of atmospheric carbon dioxide, creating a positive feedback on global climate that, once initiated, promotes cooling and further glaciation.
