Food web-specific biomagnification of persistent organic pollutants
Substances that accumulate to hazardous levels in living organisms pose environmental and human-health risks, which governments seek to reduce or eliminate. Regulatory authorities identify bioaccumulative substances as hydrophobic, fat-soluble chemicals having high octanol-water partition coefficients (K-OW) (>= 100,000). Here we show that poorly metabolizable, moderately hydrophobic substances with a K-OW between 100 and 100,000, which do not biomagnify ( that is, increase in chemical concentration in organisms with increasing trophic level) in aquatic food webs, can biomagnify to a high degree in food webs containing air-breathing animals ( including humans) because of their high octanol-air partition coefficient (K-OA) and corresponding low rate of respiratory elimination to air. These low K-OW-high K-OA chemicals, representing a third of organic chemicals in commercial use, constitute an unidentified class of potentially bioaccumulative substances that require regulatory assessment to prevent possible ecosystem and human-health consequences.
