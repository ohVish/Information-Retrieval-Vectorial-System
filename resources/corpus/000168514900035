Feynman's path-integral approach for intense-laser-atom interactions
Atoms interacting with intense laser fields can emit electrons and photons of very high energies. An intuitive and quantitative explanation of these highly nonlinear processes can be found in terms of a generalization of classical Newtonian particle trajectories, the so-called quantum orbits. Very few quantum orbits are necessary to reproduce the experimental results. These orbits are clearly identified, thus opening the way for an efficient control as well as previously unknown applications of these processes.
