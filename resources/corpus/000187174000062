Crystal structure of the RC-LH1 core complex from Rhodopseudomonas palustris
The crystal structure at 4.8 angstrom resolution of the reaction center-light harvesting 1 (RC-LH1) core complex from Rhodopseudomonas palustris shows the reaction center surrounded by an oval LH1 complex that consists of 15 pairs of transmembrane helical alpha- and beta-apoproteins and their coordinated bacteriochlorophylls. Complete closure of the RC by the LH1 is prevented by a single transmembrane helix, out of register with the array of inner LH1 alpha-apoproteins. This break, located next to the binding site in the reaction center for the secondary electron acceptor ubiquinone (UQ(B)), may provide a portal through which UQ(B) can transfer electrons to cytochrome b/c(1).
