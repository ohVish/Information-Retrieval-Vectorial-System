Molecular imaging: Looking at problems, seeing solutions
Noninvasive molecular-imaging technologies are providing researchers with exciting new opportunities to study small-animal models of human disease. With continued improvements in instrumentation, identification of better imaging targets by genome-based approaches, and design of better imaging probes by innovative chemistry, these technologies promise to play increasingly important roles in disease diagnosis and therapy.
