Detection of Earth-like planets around nearby stars using a petal-shaped occulter
Direct observation of Earth-like planets is extremely challenging, because their parent stars are about 10(10) times brighter but lie just a fraction of an arcsecond away(1). In space, the twinkle of the atmosphere that would smear out the light is gone, but the problems of light scatter and diffraction in telescopes remain. The two proposed solutions-a coronagraph internal to a telescope and nulling interferometry from formation-flying telescopes-both require exceedingly clean wavefront control in the optics(2). An attractive variation to the coronagraph is to place an occulting shield outside the telescope, blocking the starlight before it even enters the optical path(3). Diffraction and scatter around or through the occulter, however, have limited effective suppression in practically sized missions(4-6). Here I report an occulter design that would achieve the required suppression and can be built with existing technology. The compact mission architecture of a coronagraph is traded for the inconvenience of two spacecraft, but the daunting optics challenges are replaced with a simple deployable sheet 30 to 50 m in diameter. When such an occulter is flown in formation with a telescope of at least one metre aperture, terrestrial planets could be seen and studied around stars to a distance of ten parsecs.
