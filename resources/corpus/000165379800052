Intracellular parasitism by Histoplasma capsulatum: Fungal virulence and calcium dependence
Histoplasma capsulatum is an effective intracellular parasite of macrophages and causes the most prevalent fungal respiratory disease in the United States. A "dimorphic" fungus, H. capsulatum exists as a saprophytic mold in soil and converts to the parasitic yeast form after inhalation, Only the yeasts secrete a calcium-binding protein (CBP) and can grow in calcium-limiting conditions. To probe the relation between calcium Limitation and intracellular parasitism, we designed a strategy to disrupt CBP1 in H. capsulatum using a telomeric Linear plasmid and a two-step genetic selection, The resulting cbp1 yeasts no Longer grew when deprived of calcium, and they were also unable to destroy macrophages in vitro or proliferate in a mouse model of pulmonary infection.
