A myosin I isoform in the nucleus
A nuclear isoform of myosin I beta that contains a unique 16-amino acid aminoterminal extension has been identified. An affinity-purified antibody to the 16-amino acid peptide demonstrated nuclear staining. Confocal and electron microscopy revealed that nuclear myosin I beta colocalized with RNA polymerase II in an alpha-amanitin- and actinomycin D-sensitive manner. The antibody coimmunoprecipitated RNA polymerase II and blocked in vitro RNA synthesis. This isoform of myosin I beta appears to be in a complex with RNA polymerase II and may affect transcription.
