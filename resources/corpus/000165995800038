Upwelling intensification as part of the Pliocene-Pleistocene climate transition
A deep-sea sediment core underlying the Benguela upwelling system off southwest Africa provides a continuous time series of sea surface temperature (SST) for the past 4.5 million years. Our results indicate that temperatures in the region have declined by about 10 degreesC since 3.2 million years ago, Records of paleoproductivity suggest that this cooling was associated with an increase in wind-driven upwelling tied to a shift from relatively stable global warmth during the mid-Pliocene to the high-amplitude glacial-interglacial cycles of the Late Quaternary, These observations imply that Atlantic Ocean surface water circulation was radically different during the mid-Pliocene.
