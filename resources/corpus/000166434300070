New physics with the compact linear collider
Probing beyond the established picture of particle physics will require some radical re-thinking of accelerator designs. If accelerators are to reach the ever-higher energies that theorists would dearly like to see explored, the technological spin-offs of this engineering feat could be as surprising as the new subatomic physics.
