Discovery of two new satellites of Pluto
Pluto's first known satellite, Charon, was discovered(1) in 1978. It has a diameter (similar to 1,200 km) about half that of Pluto(2-4,17), which makes it larger, relative to its primary, than any other moon in the Solar System. Previous searches for other satellites around Pluto have been unsuccessful(5-7), but they were not sensitive to objects less than or similar to 150 km in diameter and there are no fundamental reasons why Pluto should not have more satellites(6). Here we report the discovery of two additional moons around Pluto, provisionally designated S/2005 P1 (hereafter P1) and S/2005 P2 (hereafter P2), which makes Pluto the first Kuiper belt object known to have multiple satellites. These new satellites are much smaller than Charon, with estimates of P1's diameter ranging from 60 km to 165 km, depending on the surface reflectivity; P2 is about 20 per cent smaller than P1. Although definitive orbits cannot be derived, both new satellites appear to be moving in circular orbits in the same orbital plane as Charon, with orbital periods of similar to 38 days (P1) and similar to 25 days (P2).
