The Landscape of C. elegans 3 ' UTRs
Three-prime untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of metazoan messenger RNAs (mRNAs) contain numerous regulatory elements, yet remain largely uncharacterized. Using polyA capture, 3' rapid amplification of complementary DNA (cDNA) ends, full-length cDNAs, and RNA-seq, we defined similar to 26,000 distinct 3'UTRs in Caenorhabditis elegans for similar to 85% of the 18,328 experimentally supported protein-coding genes and revised similar to 40% of gene models. Alternative 3'UTR isoforms are frequent, often differentially expressed during development. Average 3'UTR length decreases with animal age. Surprisingly, no polyadenylation signal (PAS) was detected for 13% of polyadenylation sites, predominantly among shorter alternative isoforms. Trans-spliced (versus non-trans-spliced) mRNAs possess longer 3'UTRs and frequently contain no PAS or variant PAS. We identified conserved 3'UTR motifs, isoform-specific predicted microRNA target sites, and polyadenylation of most histone genes. Our data reveal a rich complexity of 3'UTRs, both genome-wide and throughout development.
