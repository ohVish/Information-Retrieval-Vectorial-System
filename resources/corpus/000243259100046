A cytokinin perception mutant colonized by Rhizobium in the absence of nodule organogenesis
In legumes, Nod-factor signaling by rhizobia initiates the development of the nitrogen-fixing nodule symbiosis, but the direct cell division stimulus that brings about nodule primordia inception in the root cortex remains obscure. We showed that Lotus japonicus plants homozygous for a mutation in the HYPERINFECTED 1 (HIT1) locus exhibit abundant infection-thread formation but fail to initiate timely cortical cell divisions in response to rhizobial signaling. We demonstrated that the corresponding gene encodes a cytokinin receptor that is required for the activation of the nodule inception regulator Nin and nodule organogenesis.
