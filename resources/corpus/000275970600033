Oxide Interfaces-An Opportunity for Electronics
Extraordinary electron systems can be generated at well-defined interfaces between complex oxides. In recent years, progress has been achieved in exploring and making use of the fundamental properties of such interfaces, and it has become clear that these electron systems offer the potential for possible future devices. We trace the state of the art of this emerging field of electronics and discuss some of the challenges and pitfalls that may lie ahead.
