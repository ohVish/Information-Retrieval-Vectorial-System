A low-operating-temperature solid oxide fuel cell in hydrocarbon-air mixtures
The performance of a single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell was studied using a ceria-based solid electrolyte at temperatures below 773 kelvin. Electromotive forces of similar to 900 millivolts were generated from the cell in a flowing mixture of ethane or propane and air, where the solid electrolyte functioned as a purely ionic conductor. The electrode-reaction resistance was negligibly small in the total internal resistances of the cell. The resulting peak power density reached 403 and 101 milliwatts per square centimeter at 773 and 623 kelvin, respectively.
