Partitioning of oxygen during core formation on the Earth and Mars
Core formation on the Earth and Mars involved the physical separation of metal and silicate, most probably in deep magma oceans(1-4). Although core-formation models explain many aspects of mantle geochemistry, they have not accounted for the large differences observed between the compositions of the mantles of the Earth (similar to8 wt% FeO) and Mars (similar to18 wt% FeO) or the smaller mass fraction of the martian core(5-7). Here we explain these differences as a consequence of the solubility of oxygen in liquid iron-alloy increasing with increasing temperature. We assume that the Earth and Mars both accreted from oxidized chondritic material. In a terrestrial magma ocean, 1,200 - 2,000 km deep, high temperatures resulted in the extraction of FeO from the silicate magma ocean owing to high solubility of oxygen in the metal. Lower temperatures of a martian magma ocean resulted in little or no extraction of FeO from the mantle, which thus remains FeO-rich. The FeO extracted from the Earth's magma ocean may have contributed to chemical heterogeneities in the lowermost mantle(8), a FeO-rich D" layer(9) and the light element budget of the core(10,11).
