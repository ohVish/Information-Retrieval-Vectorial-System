Nanoscale Fe2O3-Based Catalysts for Selective Hydrogenation of Nitroarenes to Anilines
Production of anilines-key intermediates for the fine chemical, agrochemical, and pharmaceutical industries-relies on precious metal catalysts that selectively hydrogenate aryl nitro groups in the presence of other easily reducible functionalities. Herein, we report convenient and stable iron oxide (Fe2O3)-based catalysts as a more earth-abundant alternative for this transformation. Pyrolysis of iron-phenanthroline complexes on carbon furnishes a unique structure in which the active Fe2O3 particles are surrounded by a nitrogen-doped carbon layer. Highly selective hydrogenation of numerous structurally diverse nitroarenes (more than 80 examples) proceeded in good to excellent yield under industrially viable conditions.
