Trienoic fatty acids and plant tolerance of high temperature
The chloroplast membrane of higher plants contains an unusually high concentration of trienoic fatty acids. Plants grown in colder temperatures have a higher content of trienoic fatty acids. Transgenic tobacco plants in which the gene encoding chloroplast omega-3 fatty acid desaturase, which synthesizes trienoic fatty acids, was silenced contained a lower level of trienoic fatty acids than wild-type plants and were better able to acclimate to higher temperatures.
