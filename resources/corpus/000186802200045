Genetic analysis of a high-level vancomycin-resistant isolate of Staphylococcus aureus
Vancomycin is usually reserved for treatment of serious infections, including those caused by multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. A clinical isolate of S. aureus with high-level resistance to vancomycin ( minimal inhibitory concentration = 1024 mug/ml) was isolated in June 2002. This isolate harbored a 57.9-kilobase multiresistance conjugative plasmid within which Tn1546 (vanA) was integrated. Additional elements on the plasmid encoded resistance to trimethoprim (dfrA), beta-lactams (blaZ), aminoglycosides (aacA-aphD), and disinfectants ( qacC). Genetic analyses suggest that the long-anticipated transfer of vancomycin resistance to a methicillin-resistant S. aureus occurred in vivo by interspecies transfer of Tn1546 from a co-isolate of Enterococcus faecalis.
