Dust measurements in the coma of comet 81P/Wild 2 by the Dust Flux Monitor Instrument
We present measurements of the dust particle flux and mass distribution from the Stardust Dust Flux Monitor Instrument (DFMI) throughout the flyby of comet 81P/Wild 2. In the particle mass regime from 10(-14) to 10(-7) kilograms, the spacecraft encountered regions of intense swarms of particles, together with bursts of activity corresponding to clouds of particles only a few hundred meters across. This fine-scale structure can be explained by particle fragmentation. We estimate that 2800+/-500 particles of diameter 15 micrometers or larger impacted the aerogel collectors, the largest being similar to6x10(-7) kilograms, which dominates the total collected mass.
