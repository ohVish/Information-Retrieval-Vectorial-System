The molecular choreography of a store-operated calcium channel
Store-operated calcium channels (SOCs) serve essential functions from secretion and motility to gene expression and cell growth. A fundamental mystery is how the depletion of Ca(2+) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) activates Ca(2+) entry through SOCs in the plasma membrane. Recent studies using genetic approaches have identified genes encoding the ER Ca(2+) sensor and a prototypic SOC, the Ca(2+)-release-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC) channel. New findings reveal a unique mechanism for channel activation, in which the CRAC channel and its sensor migrate independently to closely apposed sites of interaction in the ER and the plasma membrane.
