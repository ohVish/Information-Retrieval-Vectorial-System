Three-Dimensional Correlation of Steric and Electronic Free Energy Relationships Guides Asymmetric Propargylation
Chemical reaction outcomes are often rationalized on the basis of independent analyses of steric and electronic effects. We applied three-dimensional free energy relationships correlating steric and electronic effects to design and optimize a ligand class for the enantioselective Nozaki-Hiyama-Kishi propargylation of ketones. The resultant mathematical model describing the steric and electronic parameter relationship is highly reliant on the synergistic interactions of these two effects.
