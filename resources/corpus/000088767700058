Microbial genome sequencing
Complete genome sequences of 30 microbial species have been determined during the past five years, and work in progress indicates that the complete sequences of more than 100 further microbial species will be available in the next two to four years. These results have revealed a tremendous amount of information on the physiology and evolution of microbial species, and should provide novel approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of infectious disease.
