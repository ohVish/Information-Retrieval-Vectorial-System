H(2)S as a physiologic vasorelaxant: Hypertension in mice with deletion of cystathionine gamma-lyase
Studies of nitric oxide over the past two decades have highlighted the fundamental importance of gaseous signaling molecules in biology and medicine. The physiological role of other gases such as carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) is now receiving increasing attention. Here we show that H(2)S is physiologically generated by cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE) and that genetic deletion of this enzyme in mice markedly reduces H(2)S levels in the serum, heart, aorta, and other tissues, Mutant mice lacking CSE display pronounced hypertension and diminished endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation. CSE is physiologically activated by calcium-calmodulin, which is a mechanism for H(2)S formation in response to vascular activation. These findings provide direct evidence that H(2)S is a physiologic vasodilator and regulator of blood pressure.
