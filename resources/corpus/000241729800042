Coherent electronic fringe structure in incommensurate silver-silicon quantum wells
Atomically uniform silver films grown on highly doped n-type Si( 111) substrates show fine-structured electronic fringes near the silicon valence band edge as observed by angle-resolved photoemission. No such fringes are observed for silver films grown on lightly doped n-type substrates or p-type substrates, although all cases exhibited the usual quantum-well states corresponding to electron confinement in the film. The fringes correspond to electronic states extending over the silver film as a quantum well and reaching into the silicon substrate as a quantum slope, with the two parts coherently coupled through an incommensurate interface structure.
