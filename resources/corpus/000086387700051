Identification of a coordinate regulator of interleukins 4, 13, and 5 by cross-species sequence comparisons
Long-range regulatory elements are difficult to discover experimentally; how-ever, they tend to be conserved among mammals, suggesting that cross-species sequence comparisons should identify them. To search for regulatory sequences, we examined about 1 megabase of orthologous human and mouse sequences for conserved noncoding elements with greater than or equal to 70% identity over at Least 100 base pairs. Ninety noncoding sequences meeting these criteria were discovered, and the analysis of 15 of these elements found that about 70% were conserved across mammals. Characterization of the Largest element in yeast artificial chromosome transgenic mice revealed it to be a coordinate regulator of three genes, interleukin-4, interleukin-13, and interleukin-5, spread over 120 kilobases.
