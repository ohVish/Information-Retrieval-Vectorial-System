Ordering genes in a flagella pathway by analysis of expression kinetics from living bacteria
The recent advances in large-scale monitoring of gene expression raise the challenge of mapping systems on the basis of kinetic expression data in living cells. To address this, we measured promoter activity in the flagellar system of Escherichia coli at high accuracy and temporal resolution by means of reporter plasmids. The genes in the pathway were ordered by analysis algorithms without dependence on mutant strains. The observed temporal program of transcription was much more detailed than was previously thought and was associated with multiple steps of flagella assembly.
