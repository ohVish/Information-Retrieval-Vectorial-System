Synchronous tropical South China Sea SST change and Greenland warming during deglaciation
The tropical ocean plays a major role in global climate, It is therefore crucial to establish the precise phase between tropical and high-latitude climate variability during past abrupt climate events in order to gain insight into the mechanisms of global climate change. Here we present alkenone sea surface temperature (SST) records from the tropical South China Sea that show an abrupt temperature increase of at least 1 degreesC at the end of the Last glacial period. Within the recognized dating uncertainties, this SST increase is synchronous with the Bolling warming observed at 14.6 thousand years ago in the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 ice core.
