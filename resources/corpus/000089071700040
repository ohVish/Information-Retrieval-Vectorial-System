Enhanced room-temperature geometric magnetoresistance in inhomogeneous narrow-gap semiconductors
A symmetric van der Pauw disk of homogeneous nonmagnetic indium antimonide with an embedded concentric gold inhomogeneity is found to exhibit room-temperature geometric magnetoresistance as high as 100, 9100, and 750,000 percent at magnetic fields of 0.05, 0.25, and 4.0 teslas, respectively. For inhomogeneities of sufficiently Large diameter relative to that of the surrounding disk, the resistance is field-independent up to an onset field above which it increases rapidly. These results can be understood in terms of the field-dependent deflection of current around the inhomogeneity.
