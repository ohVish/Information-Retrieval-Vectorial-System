Male mammals respond to a risk of sperm competition conveyed by odours of conspecific males
Sperm competition occurs when a female copulates with two or more males and the sperm of those males compete within the female's reproductive tract to fertilize her eggs(1,2). The frequent occurrence of sperm competition has forced males of many species to develop different strategies to overcome the sperm of competing males(1,3). A prevalent strategy is for males to increase their sperm investment ( total number of sperm allocated by a male to a particular female) after detecting a risk of sperm competition(1,3,4). It has been shown that the proportion of sperm that one male contributes to the sperm pool of a female is correlated with the proportion of offspring sired by that male(5,6). Therefore, by increasing his sperm investment a male may bias a potential spermcompetition in his favour(5,7,8). Here we show that male meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus, increase their sperm investment when they mate in the presence of another male's odours. Such an increase in sperm investment does not occur by augmenting the frequency of ejaculations, but by increasing the amount of sperm in a similar number of ejaculations.
