The Human THAP9 Gene Encodes an Active P-Element DNA Transposase
The human genome contains similar to 50 genes that were derived from transposable elements or transposons, and many are now integral components of cellular gene expression programs. The human THAP9 gene is related to the Drosophila P-element transposase. Here, we show that human THAP9 can mobilize Drosophila P-elements in both Drosophila and human cells. Chimeric proteins formed between the Drosophila P-element transposase N-terminal THAP DNA binding domain and the C-terminal regions of human THAP9 can also mobilize Drosophila P elements. Our results indicate that human THAP9 is an active DNA transposase that, although "domesticated," still retains the catalytic activity to mobilize P transposable elements across species.
