Targeted cancer therapy
Disruption of the normal regulation of cell-cycle progression and division lies at the heart of the events leading to cancer. Complex networks of regulatory factors, the tumour microenvironment and stress signals, such as those resulting from damaged DNA, dictate whether cancer cells proliferate or die. Recent progress in understanding the molecular changes that underlie cancer development offer the prospect of specifically targeting malfunctioning molecules and pathways to achieve more effective and rational cancer therapy.
