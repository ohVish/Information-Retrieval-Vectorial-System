Epidermal growth factor receptor is a cellular receptor for human cytomegalovirus
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a widespread opportunistic herpesvirus that causes severe and fatal diseases in immune-compromised individuals, including organ transplant recipients and individuals with AIDS(1). It is also a leading cause of virus-associated birth defects and is associated with atherosclerosis and letters to nature and coronary restenosis(1-3). HCMV initiates infection and intracellular signalling by binding to its cognate cellular receptors 4,5 and by activating several signalling pathways including those mediated by mitogen-activated protein kinase(5-7), phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase(8), interferons(5,9), and G proteins(10). But a cellular receptor responsible for viral entry and HCMV-induced signalling has yet to be identified. Here we show that HCMV infects cells by interacting with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and inducing signalling. Transfecting EGFR-negative cells with an EGFR complementary DNA renders non-susceptible cells susceptible to HCMV. Ligand displacement and crosslinking analyses show that HCMV interacts with EGFR through gB, its principal envelope glycoprotein. gB preferentially binds EGFR and EGFR-ErbB3 oligomeric molecules in Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with erbB family cDNAs. Taken together, these data indicate that EGFR is a necessary component for HCMV-triggered signalling and viral entry.
