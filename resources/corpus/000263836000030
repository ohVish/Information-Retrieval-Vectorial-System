A candidate sub-parsec supermassive binary black hole system
The role of mergers in producing galaxies, together with the finding that most large galaxies harbour black holes in their nuclei(1), implies that binary supermassive black hole systems should be common. Here we report that the quasar SDSS J153636.22+ 044127.0 is a plausible example of such a system. This quasar shows two broad-line emission systems, separated in velocity by 3,500km s(-1). A third system of unresolved absorption lines has an intermediate velocity. These characteristics are unique among known quasars. We interpret this object as a binary system of two black holes, having masses of 10(7.3) and 10(8.9) solar masses separated by similar to 0.1 parsec with an orbital period of similar to 100 years.
