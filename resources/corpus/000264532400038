Accretion disk winds as the jet suppression mechanism in the microquasar GRS 1915+105
Stellar-mass black holes with relativistic jets, also known as microquasars, mimic the behaviour of quasars and active galactic nuclei(1). Because timescales around stellar-mass black holes are orders of magnitude smaller than those around more distant supermassive black holes, microquasars are ideal nearby 'laboratories' for studying the evolution of accretion disks and jet formation in black-hole systems(2). Whereas studies of black holes have revealed a complex array of accretion activity, the mechanisms that trigger and suppress jet formation remain a mystery. Here we report the presence of a broad emission line in the faint, hard states and narrow absorption lines in the bright, soft states of the microquasar GRS 1915+105. ('Hard' and 'soft' denote the character of the emitted X-rays.) Because the hard states exhibit prominent radio jets(3), we argue that the broad emission line arises when the jet illuminates the inner accretion disk. The jet is weak or absent during the soft states(4), and we show that the absorption lines originate when the powerful radiation field around the black hole drives a hot wind off the accretion disk(5-7). Our analysis shows that this wind carries enough mass away from the disk to halt the flow of matter into the radio jet.
