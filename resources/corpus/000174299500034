Singlet diradicals: from transition states to crystalline compounds
Singlet diradicals are usually not energy minima. As observed by femtosecond spectroscopy, they readily couple to form sigma bonds. Substituent effects allow lifetimes to increase into the microsecond range. Taking advantage of the properties of hetero-elements, a diradical has been prepared that is indefinitely stable at room temperature. The availability of diradicals that can be handled under standard laboratory conditions wilt lead to further insight into their chemical and physical properties, raising the likelihood of practical applications, especially in the field of molecular materials such as electrical conductors and ferromagnets.
