Docking in Metal-Organic Frameworks
The use of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) so far has largely relied on nonspecific binding interactions to host small molecular guests. We used long organic struts (similar to 2 nanometers) incorporating 34- and 36-membered macrocyclic polyethers as recognition modules in the construction of several crystalline primitive cubic frameworks that engage in specific binding in a way not observed in passive, open reticulated geometries. MOF-1001 is capable of docking paraquat dication (PQT(2+)) guests within the macrocycles in a stereoelectronically controlled fashion. This act of specific complexation yields quantitatively the corresponding MOF-1001 pseudorotaxanes, as confirmed by x-ray diffraction and by solid-and solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic studies performed on MOF-1001, its pseudorotaxanes, and their molecular strut precursors. A control experiment involving the attempted inclusion of PQT(2+) inside a framework (MOF-177) devoid of polyether struts showed negligible uptake of PQT(2+), indicating the importance of the macrocyclic polyether in PQT(2+) docking.
