The preparation and structures of hydrogen ordered phases of ice
Two hydrogen ordered phases of ice were prepared by cooling the hydrogen disordered ices V and XII under pressure. Previous attempts to unlock the geometrical frustration in hydrogen-bonded structures have focused on doping with potassium hydroxide and have had success in partially increasing the hydrogen ordering in hexagonal ice I (ice Ih). By doping ices V and XII with hydrochloric acid, we have prepared ice XIII and ice XIV, and we analyzed their structures by powder neutron diffraction. The use of hydrogen chloride to release geometrical frustration opens up the possibility of completing the phase diagram of ice.
