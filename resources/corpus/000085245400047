Polarization of chemoattractant receptor signaling during neutrophil chemotaxis
Morphologic polarity is necessary for chemotaxis of mammalian cells. As a probe of intracellular signals responsible for this asymmetry, the pleckstrin homology domain of the AKT protein kinase (or protein kinase B), tagged with the green fluorescent protein (PHAKT-GFP), was expressed in neutrophils. Upon exposure of cells to chemoattractant, PHAKT-GFP is recruited selectively to membrane at the cell's leading edge, indicating an internal signaling gradient that is much steeper than that of the chemoattractant. Translocation of PHAKT-GFP is inhibited by toxin-B from Clostridium difficile, indicating that it requires activity of one or more Rho guanosine triphosphatases.
