Reduced antinociception and plasma extravasation in mice lacking a neuropeptide Y receptor
Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is believed to exert antinociceptive actions by inhibiting the release of substance P and other 'pain neurotransmitters' in the spinal cord dorsal horn(1-3). However, the physiological significance and potential therapeutic value of NPY remain obscure(4). It is also unclear which receptor subtype(s) are involved. To identify a possible physiological role for the NPY Y1 receptor in pain transmission, we generated NPY Y1 receptor null mutant (Y1(-/-)) mice by homologous recombination techniques. Here we show that Y1(-/-) mice develop hyperalgesia to acute thermal, cutaneous and visceral chemical pain, and exhibit mechanical hypersensitivity. Neuropathic pain is increased, and the mice show a complete absence of the pharmacological analgesic effects of NPY. In the periphery, Y1 receptor activation is sufficient and required for substance P release and the subsequent development of neurogenic inflammation and plasma leakage. We conclude that the Y1 receptor is required for central physiological and pharmacological NPY-induced analgesia and that its activation is both sufficient and required for the release of substance P and initiation of neurogenic inflammation.
