Tunable delay of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entanglement
Entangled systems display correlations that are stronger than can be obtained classically. This makes entanglement an essential resource for a number of applications, such as quantum information processing, quantum computing and quantum communications(1,2). The ability to control the transfer of entanglement between different locations will play a key role in these quantum protocols and enable quantum networks(3). Such a transfer requires a system that can delay quantum correlations without significant degradation, effectively acting as a short- term quantum memory. An important benchmark for such systems is the ability to delay Einstein - Podolsky - Rosen ( EPR) levels of entanglement and to be able to tune the delay. EPR entanglement is the basis for a number of quantum protocols, allowing the remote inference of the properties of one system ( to better than its standard quantum limit) through measurements on the other correlated system. Here we show that a four- wave mixing process based on a double- lambda scheme in hot Rb-85 vapour allows us to obtain an optically tunable delay for EPR entangled beams of light. A significant maximum delay, of the order of the width of the cross- correlation function, is achieved. The four- wave mixing also preserves the quantum spatial correlations of the entangled beams. We take advantage of this property to delay entangled images, making this the first step towards a quantum memory for images(4).
