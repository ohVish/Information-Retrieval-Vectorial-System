Colorado Plateau magmatism and uplift by warming of heterogeneous lithosphere
The forces that drove rock uplift of the low-relief, high-elevation, tectonically stable Colorado Plateau are the subject of long-standing debate(1-5). While the adjacent Basin and Range province and Rio Grande rift province underwent Cenozoic shortening followed by extension(6), the plateau experienced similar to 2km of rock uplift(7) without significant internal deformation(2-4). Here we propose that warming of the thicker, more iron-depleted Colorado Plateau lithosphere(8-10) over 35-40 Myr following mid-Cenozoic removal of the Farallon plate from beneath North America(11,12) is the primary mechanism driving rock uplift. In our model, conductive re-equilibration not only explains the rock uplift of the plateau, but also provides a robust geodynamic interpretation of observed contrasts between the Colorado Plateau margins and the plateau interior. In particular, the model matches the encroachment of Cenozoic magmatism from the margins towards the plateau interior at rates of 3-6 km Myr(-1) and is consistent with lower seismic velocities(13) and more negative Bouguer gravity(14) at the margins than in the plateau interior. We suggest that warming of heterogeneous lithosphere is a powerful mechanism for driving epeirogenic rock uplift of the Colorado Plateau and may be of general importance in plate-interior settings.
