Deciphering the cross-talk of implantation: Advances and challenges
Implantation involves a series of steps leading to an effective reciprocal signaling between the blastocyst and the uterus. Except for a restricted period when ovarian hormones induce a uterine receptive phase, the uterus is an unfavorable environment for blastocyst implantation. Because species-specific variations in implantation strategies exist, these differences preclude the formulation of a unifying theme for the molecular basis of this event. However, an increased understanding of mammalian implantation has been gained through the use of the mouse model. This review summarizes recognized signaling cascades and new research in mammalian implantation, based primarily on available genetic and molecular evidence from implantation studies in the mouse. Although the identification of new molecules associated with implantation in various species provides valuable insight, important questions remain regarding the common molecular mechanisms that govern this process. Understanding the mechanisms of implantation promises to help alleviate infertility, enhance fetal health, and improve contraceptive design.
