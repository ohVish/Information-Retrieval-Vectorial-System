Boron nitride nanomesh
A highly regular mesh of hexagonal boron nitride with a 3-nanometer periodicity and a 2-nanometer hole size was formed by self-assembly on a Rh(111) single crystalline surface. Two layers of mesh cover the surface uniformly after high-temperature exposure of the clean rhodium surface to borazine (HBNH)(3). The two layers are offset in such a way as to expose a minimum metal surface area. Hole formation is likely driven by the lattice mismatch of the film and the rhodium substrate. This regular nanostructure is thermally very stable and can serve as a template to organize molecules, as is exemplified by the decoration of the mesh by C-60 molecules.
