Epitopes involved in antibody-mediated protection from Ebola virus
To determine the ability of antibodies to provide protection from Ebola viruses, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the Ebola glycoprotein were generated and evaluated for efficacy. We identified several protective mAbs directed toward five unique epitopes on Ebola glycoprotein. One of the epitopes is conserved among all Ebola viruses that are known to be pathogenic for humans. Some protective mAbs were also effective therapeutically when administered to mice 2 days after exposure to Lethal Ebola virus. The identification of protective mAbs has important implications for developing vaccines and therapies for Ebola virus.
