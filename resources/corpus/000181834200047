Polymer replicas of photonic porous silicon for sensing and drug delivery applications
Elaborate one-dimensional photonic crystals are constructed from a variety of organic and biopolymers, which can be dissolved or melted, by templating the solution-cast or injection-molded materials in porous silicon or porous silicon dioxide multilayer (rugate dielectric mirror) structures. After the removal of the template by chemical dissolution, the polymer castings replicate the photonic features and the nanostructure of the master. We demonstrate that these castings can be used as vapor sensors, as deformable and tunable optical filters, and as self-reporting, bioresorbable materials.
