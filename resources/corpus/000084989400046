Inhibitors of strand transfer that prevent integration and inhibit HIV-1 replication in cells
Integrase is essential for human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) replication; however, potent inhibition of the isolated enzyme in biochemical assays has not readily translated into antiviral activity in a manner consistent with inhibition of integration. In this report, we describe diketo acid inhibitors of HIV-1 integrase that manifest antiviral activity as a consequence of their effect on integration. The antiviral activity of these compounds is due exclusively to inhibition of one of the two catalytic functions of integrase, strand transfer.
