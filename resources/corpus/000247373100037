Chromatin dynamics and the preservation of genetic information
The integrity of the genome is frequently challenged by double-strand breaks in the DNA. Defects in the cellular response to double-strand breaks are a major cause of cancer and other age-related pathologies; therefore, much effort has been directed at understanding the enzymatic mechanisms involved in recognizing, signalling and repairing double-strand breaks. Recent work indicates that chromatin - the fibres into which DNA is packaged with a proteinaceous structural polymer - has an important role in initiating, propagating and terminating this cellular response to DNA damage.
