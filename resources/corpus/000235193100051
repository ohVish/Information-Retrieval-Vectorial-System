ClpS is an essential component of the N-end rule pathway in Escherichia coli
The N-end rule states that the half-life of a protein is determined by the nature of its amino-terminal residue(1). Eukaryotes and prokaryotes use N-terminal destabilizing residues as a signal to target proteins for degradation by the N-end rule pathway. In eukaryotes an E3 ligase, N-recognin, recognizes N-end rule substrates and mediates their ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome(1,2). In Escherichia coli, N-end rule substrates are degraded by the AAA+ chaperone ClpA in complex with the ClpP peptidase (ClpAP)(3). Little is known of the molecular mechanism by which N-end rule substrates are initially selected for proteolysis. Here we report that the ClpAP-specific adaptor, ClpS, is essential for degradation of N-end rule substrates by ClpAP in bacteria. ClpS binds directly to N-terminal destabilizing residues through its substrate-binding site distal to the ClpS - ClpA interface(4), and targets these substrates to ClpAP for degradation. Degradation by the N-end rule pathway is more complex than anticipated and several other features are involved, including a net positive charge near the Nterminus and an unstructured region between the N-terminal signal and the folded protein substrate. Through interaction with this signal, ClpS converts the ClpAP machine into a protease with exquisitely defined specificity, ideally suited to regulatory proteolysis.
