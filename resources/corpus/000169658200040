Nitric oxide and the control of firefly flashing
Bioluminescent flashing is essential for firefly reproduction, yet the specific molecular mechanisms that control Light production are not well understood. We report that Light production by fireflies can be stimulated by nitric oxide (NO) gas in the presence of oxygen and that NO scavengers block bioluminescence induced by the neurotransmitter octopamine, NO synthase is robustly expressed in the firefly Lantern in cells interposed between nerve endings and the light-producing photocytes, These results suggest that NO synthesis is a key determinant of flash control in fireflies.
