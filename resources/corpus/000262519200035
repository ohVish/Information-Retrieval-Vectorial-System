Viral and cellular messenger RNA targets of viral microRNAs
Given the propensity of viruses to co- opt cellular pathways and activities for their benefit, it is perhaps not surprising that several viruses have now been shown to reshape the cellular environment by reprogramming the host's RNA- interference machinery. In particular, microRNAs are produced by the various members of the herpesvirus family during both the latent stage of the viral life cycle and the lytic ( or productive) stage. Emerging data suggest that viral microRNAs are particularly important for regulating the transition from latent to lytic replication and for attenuating antiviral immune responses.
