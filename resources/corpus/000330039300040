Charge Order Driven by Fermi-Arc Instability in Bi2Sr2-xLaxCuO6+delta
The understanding of the origin of superconductivity in cuprates has been hindered by the apparent diversity of intertwining electronic orders in these materials. We combined resonant x-ray scattering (REXS), scanning-tunneling microscopy (STM), and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) to observe a charge order that appears consistently in surface and bulk, and in momentum and real space within one cuprate family, Bi2Sr2-xLaxCuO6+delta. The observed wave vectors rule out simple antinodal nesting in the single-particle limit but match well with a phenomenological model of a many-body instability of the Fermi arcs. Combined with earlier observations of electronic order in other cuprate families, these findings suggest the existence of a generic charge-ordered state in underdoped cuprates and uncover its intimate connection to the pseudogap regime.
