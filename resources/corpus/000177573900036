Current rectification by Pauli exclusion in a weakly coupled double quantum dot system
We observe spin blockade due to Pauli exclusion in the tunneling characteristics of a coupled quantum dot system when two same-spin electrons occupy the lowest energy state in each dot. Spin blockade only occurs in one bias direction when there is asymmetry in the electron population of the two dots, leading to current recti cation. We induce the collapse of the spin blockade by applying a magnetic field to open up a new spin-triplet current-carrying channel.
