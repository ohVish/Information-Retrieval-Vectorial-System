Decamethyldizincocene, a stable compound of Zn(I) with a Zn-Zn bond
Unlike mercury, which has an extensive +1 oxidation state chemistry, zinc usually adopts the +2 oxidation state. Decamethyldizincocene, Zn-2(eta(5)-C5Me5)(2), an organometallic compound of Zn(I) formally derived from the dimetallic [Zn-Zn](2+) unit, has been isolated from the low-temperature (-10degreesC) reaction of Zn(C5Me5)(2) and Zn(C,H,), in diethyl ether. X-ray studies show that it contains two eclipsed Zn(eta(5)-C5Me5) fragments with a Zn-Zn distance (+/- standard deviation) of 2.305(+/-3) angstroms, indicative of a metal-metal bonding interaction.
