Rab1 recruitment of p115 into a cis-SNARE complex: Programming budding COPII vesicles for fusion
The guanosine triphosphatase Rab1 regulates the transport of newly synthesized proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus through interaction with effector molecules, but the molecular mechanisms by which this occurs are unknown. Here, the tethering factor p115 was shown to be a Rab1 effector that binds directly to activated Rab1. Rab1 recruited p115 to coat protein complex II (COPII) vesicles during budding from the endoplasmic reticulum, where it interacted with a select set of COPII vesicle-associated SNAREs (soluble N-ethylmateimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) to form a cis-SNARE complex that promotes targeting to the Golgi apparatus. We propose that Rab1-regulated assembly of functional effector-SNARE complexes defines a conserved molecular mechanism to coordinate recognition between subcellular compartments.
