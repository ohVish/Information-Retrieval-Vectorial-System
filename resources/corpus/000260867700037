Del-1, an Endogenous Leukocyte-Endothelial Adhesion Inhibitor, Limits Inflammatory Cell Recruitment
Leukocyte recruitment to sites of infection or inflammation requires multiple adhesive events. Although numerous players promoting leukocyte- endothelial interactions have been characterized, functionally important endogenous inhibitors of leukocyte adhesion have not been identified. Here we describe the endothelially derived secreted molecule Del-1 ( developmental endothelial locus-1) as an anti-adhesive factor that interferes with the integrin LFA-1-dependent leukocyte-endothelial adhesion. Endothelial Del-1 deficiency increased LFA- 1- dependent leukocyte adhesion in vitro and in vivo. Del-1(-/-) mice displayed significantly higher neutrophil accumulation in lipopolysaccharide- induced lung inflammation in vivo, which was reversed in Del- /LFA-1 double- deficient mice. Thus, Del- 1 is an endogenous inhibitor of inflammatory cell recruitment and could provide a basis for targeting leukocyte- endothelial interactions in disease.
