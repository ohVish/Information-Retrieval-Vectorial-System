Nitrification by plants that also fix nitrogen
Nitrification is a key stage in the nitrogen cycle; it enables the transformation of nitrogen into an oxidized, inorganic state(1,2). The availability of nitrates produced by this process often limits primary productivity and is an important determinant in plant community ecology and biodiversity(3-6). Chemoautotrophic prokaryotes are recognized as the main facilitators of this process(7), although heterotrophic nitrification by fungi may be significant under certain conditions(8). However, there has been neither biochemical nor ecological evidence to support nitrification by photoautotrophic plants. Here we show how certain legumes that accumulate the toxin, 3-nitropropionic acid, generate oxidized inorganic nitrogen in their shoots, which is returned to the soil in their litter. In nitrogen-fixing populations this 'new' nitrate and nitrite can be derived from the assimilation of nitrogen gas. Normally, the transformation of elemental nitrogen from the atmosphere into a fixed oxidized form ( as nitrate) is represented in the nitrogen cycle as a multiphasic process involving several different organisms. We show how this can occur in a single photoautotrophic organism, representing a previously undescribed feature of this biogeochemical cycle.
