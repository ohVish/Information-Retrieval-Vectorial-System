beta-cell death during progression to diabetes
The hallmark of type 1 diabetes is specific destruction of pancreatic islet beta -cells. Apoptosis of beta -cells may be crucial at several points during disease progression, initiating leukocyte invasion of the islets and terminating the production of insulin in islet cells. beta -Cell apoptosis may also be involved in the occasional evolution of type 2 into type 1 diabetes.
