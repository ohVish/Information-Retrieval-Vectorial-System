Nanoarchaeum equitans creates functional tRNAs from separate genes for their 5 '- and 3 '-halves
Analysis of the genome sequence of the small hyperthermophilic archaeal parasite Nanoarchaeum equitans(1,2) has not revealed genes encoding the glutamate, histidine, tryptophan and initiator methionine transfer RNA species. Here we develop a computational approach to genome analysis that searches for widely separated genes encoding tRNA halves that, on the basis of structural prediction, could form intact tRNA molecules. A search of the N. equitans genome reveals nine genes that encode tRNA halves; together they account for the missing tRNA genes. The tRNA sequences are split after the anticodon-adjacent position 37, the normal location of tRNA introns. The terminal sequences can be accommodated in an intervening sequence that includes a 12 - 14-nucleotide GC-rich RNA duplex between the end of the 50 tRNA half and the beginning of the 30 tRNA half. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and amino-acylation experiments of N. equitans tRNA demonstrated maturation to full-size tRNA and acceptor activity of the tRNA His and tRNA(Glu) species predicted in silico. As the joining mechanism possibly involves tRNA trans-splicing, the presence of an intron might have been required for early tRNA synthesis.
