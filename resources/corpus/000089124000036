Nicastrin modulates presenilin-mediated notch/glp-1 signal transduction and beta APP processing
Nicastrin, a transmembrane glycoprotein, forms high molecular weight complexes with presenilin 1 and presenilin 2. Suppression of nicastrin expression in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos induces a subset of notch/glp-1 phenotypes similar to those induced by simultaneous null mutations in both presenilin homologues of C. elegans(sel-12 and hop-1). Nicastrin also binds carboxy-terminal derivatives of beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta APP), and modulates the production of the amyloid beta-peptide (A beta) from these derivatives. Missense mutations in a conserved hydrophilic domain of nicastrin increase A beta(42) and A beta(40) peptide secretion. Deletions in this domain inhibit A beta production. Nicastrin and presenilins are therefore likely to be functional components of a multimeric complex necessary for the intramembranous proteolysis of proteins such as Notch/GLP-1 and beta APP.
