Structural basis for template-independent RNA polymerization
The 3'-terminal CCA nucleotide sequence ( positions 74 - 76) of transfer RNA is essential for amino acid attachment(1) and interaction with the ribosome(2-4) during protein synthesis. The CCA sequence is synthesized de novo and/or repaired by a template-independent RNA polymerase, 'CCA-adding enzyme', using CTP and ATP as substrates(5). Despite structural and biochemical studies(5-8), the mechanism by which the CCA-adding enzyme synthesizes the defined sequence without a nucleic acid template remains elusive. Here we present the crystal structure of Aquifex aeolicus CCA-adding enzyme, bound to a primer tRNA lacking the terminal adenosine and an incoming ATP analogue, at 2.8 Angstrom resolution. The enzyme enfolds the acceptor T helix of the tRNA molecule. In the catalytic pocket, C75 is adjacent to ATP, and their base moieties are stacked. The complementary pocket for recognizing C74-C75 of tRNA forms a 'protein template' for the penultimate two nucleotides, mimicking the nucleotide template used by template-dependent polymerases. These results are supported by systematic analyses of mutants. Our structure represents the 'pre-insertion' stage of selecting the incoming nucleotide and provides the structural basis for the mechanism underlying template-independent RNA polymerization.
