Synthesis and Structure of a Terminal Uranium Nitride Complex
The terminal uranium nitride linkage is a fundamental target in the study of f-orbital participation in metal-ligand multiple bonding but has previously eluded characterization in an isolable molecule. Here, we report the preparation of the terminal uranium(V) nitride complex [UN(Tren(TIPS))][Na(12-crown-4)(2)] {in which Tren(TIPS) = [N(CH2CH2NSiPr3i)(3)](3-)and Pr-i = CH(CH3)(2)} by reaction of the uranium(III) complex [U(Tren(TIPS))] with sodium azide followed by abstraction and encapsulation of the sodium cation by the polydentate crown ether 12-crown-4. Single-crystal x-ray diffraction reveals a uranium-terminal nitride bond length of 1.825(15) angstroms (where 15 is the standard uncertainty). The structural assignment is supported by means of N-15-isotopic labeling, electronic absorption spectroscopy, magnetometry, electronic structure calculations, elemental analyses, and liberation of ammonia after treatment with water.
