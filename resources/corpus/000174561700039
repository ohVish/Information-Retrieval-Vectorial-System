Liquid-state NMR and scalar couplings in microtesla magnetic fields
We obtained nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of liquids in fields of a few microtesla, using prepolarization in fields of a few millitesta and detection with a dc superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). Because the sensitivity of the SQUID is frequency independent, we enhanced both signal-to-noise ratio and spectral resolution by detecting the NMR signal in extremely tow magnetic fields, where the NMR tines become very narrow even for grossly inhomogeneous measurement fields. In the absence of chemical shifts, proton-phosphorous scalar (J) couplings have been detected, indicating the presence of specific covalent bonds. This observation opens the possibility for "pure J spectroscopy" as a diagnostic tool, for the detection of molecules in low magnetic fields.
