Residential biofuels in south Asia: Carbonaceous aerosol emissions and climate impacts
High concentrations of pollution particles, including "soot" or black carbon,,exist over the Indian Ocean, but their sources and geographical origins are not well understood. We measured emissions from the combustion of biofuets, used widely in south Asia for cooking, and found that large amounts of carbonaceous aerosols are emitted per kilogram of fuel burnt. We calculate that biofuel combustion is the largest source of black carbon emissions in India, and we suggest that its control is central to climate change mitigation in the south Asian region.
