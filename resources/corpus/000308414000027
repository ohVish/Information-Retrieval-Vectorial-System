How Cells Know the Size of Their Organelles
Cells have developed ways to sense and control the size of their organelles. Size-sensing mechanisms range from direct measurements provided by dedicated reporters to indirect functional readouts, and they are used to modify organelle size under both normal and stress conditions. Organelle size can also be controlled in the absence of an identifiable size sensor. Studies on flagella have dissected principles of size sensing and control, and it will be exciting to see how these principles apply to other organelles.
