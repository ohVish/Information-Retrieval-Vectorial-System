Ultrafast electron localization dynamics following photo-induced charge transfer
Molecular dynamics occurring in the earliest stages following photo-induced charge transfer were investigated. Femtosecond time-resolved absorption anisotropy measurements on [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+), where bpy is 2,2'-bipyridine, reveal a time dependence in nitrile solutions attributed to initial delocalization of the excited state over all three Ligands followed by charge Localization onto a single Ligand. The localization process is proposed to be coupled to nondiffusive solvation dynamics. In contrast, measurements sampling population dynamics show spectral evolution associated with wave packet motion on the excited state surface that is independent of solvent. The results therefore reveal two important contributions to the evolution of charge transfer states in condensed phase, one that is strongly coupled to the surrounding environment and another that follows a potential internal to the molecule.
