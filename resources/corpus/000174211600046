Balanced responsiveness to chemoattractants from adjacent zones determines B-cell position
B lymphocytes re-circulate between B-cell-rich compartments (follicles or B zones) in secondary lymphoid organs, surveying for antigen. After antigen binding, B cells move to the boundary of B and T zones to interact with T-helper cells(1-3). Despite the importance of B-T-cell interactions for the induction of antibody responses, the mechanism causing B-cell movement to the T zone has not been defined. Here we show that antigen-engaged B cells have increased expression of CCR7, the receptor for the T-zone chemokines(4,5) CCL19 and CCL21, and that they exhibit increased responsiveness to both chemoattractants. In mice lacking lymphoid CCL19 and CCL21 chemokines, or with B cells that lack CCR7, antigen engagement fails to cause movement to the T zone. Using retroviral-mediated gene transfer we demonstrate that increased expression of CCR7 is sufficient to direct B cells to the T zone. Reciprocally, overexpression of CXCR5, the receptor for the B-zone chemokine CXCL13, is sufficient to overcome antigen-induced B-cell movement to the T zone. These findings define the mechanism of B-cell relocalization in response to antigen, and establish that cell position in vivo can be determined by the balance of responsiveness to chemoattractants made in separate but adjacent zones.
