Discovery of gaseous S-2 in Io's Pele plume
Spectroscopy of Io's Pele plume against Jupiter by the Hubble Space Telescope in October 1999 revealed absorption due to S-2 gas, with a column density of 1.0 +/- 0.2 x 10(16) per square centimeter, and probably also SO2 gas with a column density of 7 +/- 3 x 10(16) per square centimeter. This SO2/S-2 ratio (3 to 12) is expected from equilibration with silicate magmas near the quartz-fayalite-magnetite or wustite-magnetite buffers. Condensed S-3 and S-4, probable coloring agents in Pele's red plume deposits, may form by polymerization of the S-2, which is unstable to ultraviolet photolysis. Diffuse red deposits near other to volcanoes suggest that venting and polymerization of S-2 gas is a widespread feature of Io volcanism.
