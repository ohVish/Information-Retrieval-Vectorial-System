Phospholipase C gamma 1 controls surface expression of TRPC3 through an intermolecular PH domain
Many ion channels are regulated by lipids(1-3), but prominent motifs for lipid binding have not been identified in most ion channels. Recently, we reported that phospholipase Cgamma1 (PLC-gamma1) binds to and regulates TRPC3 channels(4), components of agonist-induced Ca2+ entry into cells. This interaction requires a domain in PLC-gamma1 that includes a partial pleckstrin homology (PH)domain - a consensus lipid-binding and protein-binding sequence(5,6). We have developed a gestalt algorithm to detect hitherto 'invisible' PH and PH-like domains, and now report that the partial PH domain of PLC-gamma1 interacts with a complementary partial PH-like domain in TRPC3 to elicit lipid binding and cell-surface expression of TRPC3. Our findings imply a far greater abundance of PH domains than previously appreciated, and suggest that intermolecular PH-like domains represent a widespread signalling mode.
