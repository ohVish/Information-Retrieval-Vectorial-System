Selectivity for 3D shape that reveals distinct areas within macaque inferior temporal cortex
The anterior part of the macaque inferior temporal cortex, area TE, occupies a Large portion of the temporal Lobe and is critical for object recognition. Thus far, no relation between anatomical subdivisions of TE and neuronal selectivity has been described. Here, we present evidence that neurons selective for three-dimensional (3D) shape are concentrated in the lower bank of the superior temporal sulcus, whereas neurons in lateral TE are generally unselective for 3D shape, though equally selective for 2D shape. These findings reveal that TE consists of at Least two distinct areas, one of which processes a specific object property.
