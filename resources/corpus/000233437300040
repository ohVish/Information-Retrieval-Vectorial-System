Porous, crystalline, covalent organic frameworks
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been designed and successfully synthesized by condensation reactions of phenyl diboronic acid {C6H4[B(OH)(2)](2)} and hexahydroxytriphenylene [C18H6(OH)(6)]. Powder x-ray diffraction studies of the highly crystalline products (C3H2BO)(6)center dot(C9H12)(1) (COF-1) and C9H4BO2 (COF-5) revealed expanded porous graphitic layers that are either staggered (COF-1, P6(3)/mmc) or eclipsed (COF-5, P6/mmm). Their crystal structures are entirely held by strong bonds between B, C, and O atoms to form rigid porous architectures with pore sizes ranging from 7 to 27 angstroms. COF-1 and COF-5 exhibit high thermal stability (to temperatures up to 500 degrees to 600 degrees C), permanent porosity, and high surface areas (711 and 1590 square meters per gram, respectively).
