A genetic framework for improving arrhythmia therapy
Abnormalities in heart rhythm continue to cause high rates of illness and death. Better treatment could be provided by solving two main challenges: the early identification of patients who are at risk, and the characterization of molecular pathways that culminate in arrhythmias. By analysing mechanisms that increase susceptibility to arrhythmia in individuals with genetic syndromes, it might be possible to improve current therapies and to develop new ways to treat and prevent common arrhythmias.
