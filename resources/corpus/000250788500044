Rheb activates mTOR by antagonizing its endogenous inhibitor, FKBP38
The mammalian target of rapamycin, mTOR, is a central regulator of cell growth. Its activity is regulated by Rheb, a Ras-like small guanosine triphosphatase ( GTPase), in response to growth factor stimulation and nutrient availability. We show that Rheb regulates mTOR through FKBP38, a member of the FK506-binding protein ( FKBP) family that is structurally related to FKBP12. FKBP38 binds to mTOR and inhibits its activity in a manner similar to that of the FKBP12-rapamycin complex. Rheb interacts directly with FKBP38 and prevents its association with mTOR in a guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP)-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that FKBP38 is an endogenous inhibitor of mTOR, whose inhibitory activity is antagonized by Rheb in response to growth factor stimulation and nutrient availability.
