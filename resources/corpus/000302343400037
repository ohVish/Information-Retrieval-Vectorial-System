A steady-state superradiant laser with less than one intracavity photon
The spectral purity of an oscillator is central to many applications, such as detecting gravity waves(1), defining the second(2,3), ground-state cooling and quantum manipulation of nanomechanical objects(4), and quantum computation(5). Recent proposals(6-9) suggest that laser oscillators which use very narrow optical transitions in atoms can be orders of magnitude more spectrally pure than present lasers. Lasers of this high spectral purity are predicted to operate deep in the 'bad-cavity', or superradiant, regime, where the bare atomic linewidth is much less than the cavity linewidth. Here we demonstrate a Raman superradiant laser source in which spontaneous synchronization of more than one million rubidium-87 atomic dipoles is continuously sustained by less than 0.2 photons on average inside the optical cavity. By operating at low intracavity photon number, we demonstrate isolation of the collective atomic dipole from the environment by a factor of more than ten thousand, as characterized by cavity frequency pulling measurements. The emitted light has a frequency linewidth, measured relative to the Raman dressing laser, that is less than that of single-particle decoherence linewidths and more than ten thousand times less than the quantum linewidth limit typically applied to 'good-cavity' optical lasers(10), for which the cavity linewidth is much less than the atomic linewidth. These results demonstrate several key predictions for future superradiant lasers, which could be used to improve the stability of passive atomic clocks(3) and which may lead to new searches for physics beyond the standard model(11,12).
