Transcription-coupled events associating with immunoglobulin switch region chromatin
Class switch recombination (CSR) at the antibody immunoglobulin locus is regulated by germline transcription (GLT) - coupled modi. cations in the accessibility of the switch region, where CSR takes place. Here we show that histone acetylation of switch regions is linked to CSR but that histone acetylation cannot alone promote CSR or GLT. Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) specifically associates with the CSR target chromatin in a GLT-coupled manner, which may occur potentially by means of physical interaction between AID and the transcription machinery. These data indicate an important role of GLT in the regulation of chromatin accessibility, strongly suggesting that the target of AID is chromatin DNA. Our results give insights on the role of AID and the regulatory mechanism of CSR.
