Hypomethylation-linked activation of PAX2 mediates tamoxifen-stimulated endometrial carcinogenesis
Tamoxifen, a selective oestrogen receptor modulator, has been used in the treatment of all stages of hormone-responsive breast cancer. However, tamoxifen shows partial oestrogenic activity in the uterus and its use has been associated with an increased incidence of endometrial cancer. The molecular explanation for these observations is not known. Here we show that tamoxifen and oestrogen have distinct but overlapping target gene profiles. Among the overlapping target genes, we identify a paired-box gene, PAX2, that is crucially involved in cell proliferation and carcinogenesis in the endometrium. Our experiments show that PAX2 is activated by oestrogen and tamoxifen in endometrial carcinomas but not in normal endometrium, and that this activation is associated with cancer-linked hypomethylation of the PAX2 promoter.
