Postnatal neurodevelopmental disorders: Meeting at the synapse?
We often think of neurodevelopmental disorders as beginning before birth, and many certainly do. A handful, however, strike many months after birth, following a period of apparently normal growth and development. Autism and Rett syndrome are two such disorders, and here I consider some of their similarities at the phenotypic and pathogenic levels. I propose that both disorders result from disruption of postnatal or experience-dependent synaptic plasticity.
