Fully state-resolved differential cross sections for the inelastic scattering of the open-shell NO molecule by Ar
State-resolved differential cross sections (DCSs) for the inelastic scattering of NO(j" = 0.5, Omega" = 1/2) + Ar --> NO(j', Omega' = 1/2, 3/2) + Ar were obtained at a collision energy of 516 cm(-1), both experimentally and theoretically. A crossed molecular beam ion-imaging apparatus was used to measure DCSs for 20 final (j', Omega') states, including spin-orbit conserving (Delta Omega = 0) and changing (Delta Omega = 1) transitions. Quantum close-coupling scattering calculations on ab initio coupled-cluster CCSD(T) and CEPA (correlated electron pair approximation) potential energy surfaces were also performed. Although small discrepancies were found for the Delta Omega = 1 transitions, we find marked agreement between theory and experiment for the collision dynamics of this system, which is the paradigm for the collisional relaxation of a molecular radical.
