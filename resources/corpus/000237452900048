PIN proteins perform a rate-limiting function in cellular auxin efflux
Intercellular flow of the phytohormone auxin underpins multiple developmental processes in plants. Plant-specific pin-formed ( PIN) proteins and several phosphoglycoprotein (PGP) transporters are crucial factors in auxin transport - related development, yet the molecular function of PINs remains unknown. Here, we show that PINs mediate auxin efflux from mammalian and yeast cells without needing additional plant-specific factors. Conditional gain-of-function alleles and quantitative measurements of auxin accumulation in Arabidopsis and tobacco cultured cells revealed that the action of PINs in auxin efflux is distinct from PGP, rate-limiting, specific to auxins, and sensitive to auxin transport inhibitors. This suggests a direct involvement of PINs in catalyzing cellular auxin efflux.
