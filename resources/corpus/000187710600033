High-performance solid acid fuel cells through humidity stabilization
Although they hold the promise of clean energy, state-of-the-art fuel cells based on polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells are inoperable above 100degreesC, require cumbersome humidification systems, and suffer from fuel permeation. These difficulties all arise from the hydrated nature of the electrolyte. In contrast, "solid acids" exhibit anhydrous proton transport and high-temperature stability. We demonstrate continuous, stable power generation for both H-2/O-2 and direct methanol fuel cells operated at similar to250degreesC using a humidity-stabilized solid acid CsH2PO4 electrolyte.
