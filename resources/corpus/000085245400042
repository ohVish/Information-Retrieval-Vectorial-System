Ambipolar pentacene field-effect transistors and inverters (Retracted article. See vol 298, pg 961, 2002)
Organic field-effect transistors based on pentacene single crystals, prepared with an amorphous aluminum oxide gate insulator, are capable of ambipolar operation and can be used for the preparation of complementary inverter circuits. The field-effect mobilities of carriers in these transistors increase from 2.7 and 1.7 square centimeters per volt per second at room temperature up to 1200 and 320 square centimeters per volt per second at Low temperatures for hole and electron transport, respectively, following a power-law dependence. The possible simplification of the fabrication process of complementary Logic circuits with these transistors, together with the high carrier mobilities, may be seen as another step toward applications of plastic electronics.
