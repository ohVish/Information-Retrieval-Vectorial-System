Creation and manipulation of three-dimensional optically trapped structures
An interferometric pattern between two annular laser beams is used to construct three-dimensional (3D) trapped structures within an optical tweezers setup. In addition to being fully translatable in three dimensions, the trapped structure can be rotated controllably and continuously by introducing a frequency difference between the two laser beams. These interference patterns could play an important rote in the creation of extended 3D crystalline structures.
