Universality and critical behavior at the Mott transition
We report conductivity measurements of Cr-doped V2O3 using a variable pressure technique. The critical behavior of the conductivity near the Mott insulator to metal critical endpoint is investigated in detail as a function of pressure and temperature. The critical exponents are determined, as well as the scaling function associated with the equation of state. The universal properties of a liquid-gas transition are found. This is potentially a generic description of the Mott critical endpoint in correlated electron materials.
