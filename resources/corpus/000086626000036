Sources of quantum protection in high-T-c superconductivity
The layer-structure cuprates with high superconducting transition temperatures T-c exhibit a number of anomalous electronic properties in both superconducting and normal states. These anomalies are ascribed to the existence of independent spectra of excitations for charge and for spin, signaling a collective state, a "quantum protectorate."
