Infrared spectroscopic evidence for protonated water clusters forming nanoscale cages
Size-dependent development of the hydrogen bond network structure in large-sized clusters of protonated water, H+(H2O)(n) ( n = 4 to 27), was probed by infrared spectroscopy of OH stretches. Spectral changes with cluster size demonstrate that the chain structures at small sizes ( n less than or similar to 10) develop into two-dimensional net structures ( similar to 10 < n < 21), and then into nanometer-scaled cages ( n greater than or equal to 21).
