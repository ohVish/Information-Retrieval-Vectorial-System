Extra dimensions and warped geometries
The field of extra dimensions, as well as the hypothesized sizes of extra dimensions, have grown by leaps and bounds over the past few years. I summarize the new results and the reasons for the recent activity in this field. These include the observations that extra dimensions can be macroscopic or even infinite in size. Another new development is the application of extra dimensions to the determination of particle physics parameters and properties.
