Cytosolic Viral Sensor RIG-I Is a 5 '-Triphosphate-Dependent Translocase on Double-Stranded RNA
Retinoic acid inducible- gene I ( RIG- I) is a cytosolic multidomain protein that detects viral RNA and elicits an antiviral immune response. Two N- terminal caspase activation and recruitment domains ( CARDs) transmit the signal, and the regulatory domain prevents signaling in the absence of viral RNA. 5 '- triphosphate and double- stranded RNA ( dsRNA) are two molecular patterns that enable RIG- I to discriminate pathogenic from self- RNA. However, the function of the DExH box helicase domain that is also required for activity is less clear. Using single- molecule protein- induced fluorescence enhancement, we discovered a robust adenosine 5 ' - triphosphate- powered dsRNA translocation activity of RIG- I. The CARDs dramatically suppress translocation in the absence of 5 '- triphosphate, and the activation by 5 '- triphosphate triggers RIG- I to translocate preferentially on dsRNA in cis. This functional integration of two RNA molecular patterns may provide a means to specifically sense and counteract replicating viruses.
