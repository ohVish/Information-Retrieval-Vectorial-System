Coordination of meiotic recombination, pairing, and synapsis by PHS1
Pairing, synapsis, and recombination are prerequisites for accurate chromosome segregation in meiosis. The phs1 gene in maize is required for pairing to occur between homologous chromosomes. In the phs1 mutant, homologous chromosome synapsis is completely replaced by synapsis between nonhomologous partners. The phs1 gene is also required for installation of the meiotic recombination machinery on chromosomes, as the mutant almost completely lacks chromosomal foci of the recombination protein RAD51. Thus, in the phs1 mutant, synapsis is uncoupled from recombination and pairing. The protein encoded by the phs1 gene likely acts in a multistep process to coordinate pairing, recombination, and synapsis.
