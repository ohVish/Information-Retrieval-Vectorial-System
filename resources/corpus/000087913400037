Cross talk between interferon-gamma and -alpha/beta signaling components in caveolar membrane domains
Definition of cellular responses to cytokines often involves cross-communication through their respective receptors. Here, signaling by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is shown to depend on the IFN-alpha/beta receptor components. Although these IFNs transmit signals through distinct receptor complexes, the IFN-alpha/beta receptor component, IFNAR1, facilitates efficient assembly of IFN-gamma-activated transcription factors. This cross talk is contingent on a constitutive subthreshold IFN-alpha/beta signaling and the association between the two nonligand-binding receptor components, IFNAR1 and IFNGR2, in the caveolar membrane domains. This aspect of signaling cross talk by IFNs may apply to other cytokines.
