Separation of metallic from semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes
We have developed a method to separate metallic from semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes from suspension using alternating current dielectrophoresis. Our method takes advantage of the difference of the relative dielectric constants of the two species with respect to the solvent, resulting in an opposite movement of metallic and semiconducting tubes along the electric field gradient. Metallic tubes are attracted toward a microelectrode array, leaving semiconducting tubes in the solvent. Proof of the effectiveness of separation is given by a comparative Raman spectroscopy study on the dielectrophoretically deposited tubes and on a reference sample.
