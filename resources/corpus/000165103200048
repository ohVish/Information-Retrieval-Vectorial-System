VirB/D4-dependent protein translocation from Agrobacterium into plant cells
The Agrobacterium VirB/D4 transport system mediates the transfer of a nucleoprotein T complex into plant cells, Leading to crown gall disease. In addition, several Virulence proteins must somehow be transported to fulfill a function in planta. Here, we used fusions between Cre recombinase and VirE2 or VirF to directly demonstrate protein translocation into plant cells. Transport of the proteins was monitored by a Cre-mediated in planta recombination event resulting in a selectable phenotype and depended on the VirB/D4 transport system but did not require transferred DNA.
