Mesoporous silicates prepared using preorganized templates in supercritical fluids
Well-ordered mesoporous silicate films were prepared by infusion and selective condensation of silicon alkoxides within microphase-separated block copolymer templates dilated with supercritical carbon dioxide. Confinement of metal oxide deposition to specific subdomains of the pre-organized template yields high-fidelity, three-dimensional replication of the copolymer morphology, enabling the preparation of structures with multiscale order in a process that closely resembles biomineralization. Ordered mesoporous silicate films were synthesized with dielectric constants as low as 1.8 and excellent mechanical properties. The films survive the chemical-mechanical polishing step required for device manufacturing.
