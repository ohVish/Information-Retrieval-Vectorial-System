A phosphatocopid crustacean with appendages from the Lower Cambrian
Here we describe a phosphatocopid arthropod with preserved soft anatomy from Lower Cambrian rocks of 5hropshire, England, which provides evidence for the occurrence of Crustacea, including Eucrustacea, in the Early Cambrian. The find identifies an important, stratigraphically early source of well-preserved fossils (Konservat-Lagerstatte).
