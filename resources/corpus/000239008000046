Ca2+ entry through plasma membrane IP3 receptors
Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP(3)Rs) release calcium ions, Ca2+, from intracellular stores, but their roles in mediating Ca2+ entry are unclear. IP3 stimulated opening of very few (1.9 +/- 0.2 per cell) Ca2+-permeable channels in whole-cell patch-clamp recording of DT40 chicken or mouse B cells. Activation of the B cell receptor (BCR) in perforated-patch recordings evoked the same response. IP3 failed to stimulate intracellular or plasma membrane ( PM) channels in cells lacking IP3 R. Expression of IP3R restored both responses. Mutations within the pore affected the conductances of IP3-activated PM and intracellular channels similarly. An impermeant pore mutant abolished BCR-evoked Ca2+ signals, and PM IP(3)Rs were undetectable. After introduction of an alpha-bungarotoxin binding site near the pore, PM IP(3)Rs were modulated by extracellular alpha-bungarotoxin. IP(3)Rs are unusual among endoplasmic reticulum proteins in being also functionally expressed at the PM, where very few IP(3)Rs contribute substantially to the Ca2+ entry evoked by the BCR.
