The Global Magnetic Field of Mercury from MESSENGER Orbital Observations
Magnetometer data acquired by the MESSENGER spacecraft in orbit about Mercury permit the separation of internal and external magnetic field contributions. The global planetary field is represented as a southward-directed, spin-aligned, offset dipole centered on the spin axis. Positions where the cylindrical radial magnetic field component vanishes were used to map the magnetic equator and reveal an offset of 484 +/- 11 kilometers northward of the geographic equator. The magnetic axis is tilted by less than 3 degrees from the rotation axis. A magnetopause and tail-current model was defined by using 332 magnetopause crossing locations. Residuals of the net external and offset-dipole fields from observations north of 30 degrees N yield a best-fit planetary moment of 195 +/- 10 nanotesla-R-M(3), where R-M is Mercury's mean radius.
