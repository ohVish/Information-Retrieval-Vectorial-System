Structural basis for Duffy recognition by the malaria parasite Duffy-binding-like domain
Molecular processes that govern pathogenic features of erythrocyte invasion and cytoadherence in malaria are reliant on Plasmodium-specific Duffy-binding-like domains (DBLs)(1). These cysteine-rich modules recognize diverse host cell-surface receptors during pathogenesis. DBLs of parasite erythrocyte-binding proteins mediate invasion, and those from the antigenically variant P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 ( PfEMP1) have been implicated in cytoadherence. The simian and human malarial parasites, P. knowlesi and P. vivax, invade human erythrocytes exclusively through the host DARC receptor ( Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines)(2,3). Here we present the crystal structure of the P. knowlesi DBL domain (Pk alpha-DBL), which binds to DARC during invasion of human erythrocytes. Pk alpha-DBL retains the overall fold observed in DBLs from P. falciparum erythrocyte-binding antigen (EBA)- 175 (ref. 4). Mapping the residues that have previously been implicated in binding(5-7) highlights a fairly flat but exposed site for DARC recognition in subdomain 2 of Pk alpha-DBL; this is in sharp contrast to receptor recognition by EBA- 175 ( ref. 4). In Pk alpha-DBL, the residues that contact DARC and the clusters of residues under immune pressure map to opposite surfaces of the DBL, and suggest a possible mechanism for immune evasion by P. vivax. Our comparative structural analysis of Pk alpha-DBL and P. falciparum EBA- 175 provides a framework for the understanding of malaria parasite DBLs, and may affect the development of new prophylactic and therapeutic strategies.
