The intracellular fate of Salmonella depends on the recruitment of kinesin
Salmonella enterica causes a variety of diseases, including gastroenteritis and typhoid fever. The success of this pathogen depends on its capacity to proliferate within host cells in a membrane-bound compartment. We found that the Salmonella-containing vacuole recruited the plus-end-directed motor kinesin. Bacterial effector proteins translocated into the host cell by a type III secretion system antagonistically regulated this event. Among these effectors, SifA targeted SKIP, a host protein that down-regulated the recruitment of kinesin on the bacterial. vacuole and, in turn, controlled vacuolar membrane dynamics.
