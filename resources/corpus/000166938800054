Evolutionary analyses of the human genome
The completion of the human genome will greatly accelerate the development of a new branch of science - evolutionary genomics. We can now directly address important questions about the evolutionary history of human genes and their regulatory sequences. Computational analyses of the human genome will reveal the number of genes and repetitive elements, the extent of gene duplication and compositional heterogeneity in the human genome, and the extent of domain shuffling and domain sharing among proteins. Here we present some first glimpses of these features.
