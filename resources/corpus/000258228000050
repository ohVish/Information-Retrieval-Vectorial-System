Crystal structure of the neurotrophin-3 and p75(NTR) symmetrical complex
Neurotrophins (NTs) are important regulators for the survival, differentiation and maintenance of different peripheral and central neurons. NTs bind to two distinct classes of glycosylated receptor: the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR)) and tyrosine kinase receptors (Trks). Whereas p75(NTR) binds to all NTs, the Trk subtypes are specific for each NT1,2. The question of whether NTs stimulate p75(NTR) by inducing receptor homodimerization is still under debate. Here we report the 2.6-angstrom resolution crystal structure of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) complexed to the ectodomain of glycosylated p75(NTR). In contrast to the previously reported asymmetric complex structure, which contains a dimer of nerve growth factor (NGF) bound to a single ectodomain of deglycosylated p75(NTR) (ref. 3), we show that NT-3 forms a central homodimer around which two glycosylated p75(NTR) molecules bind symmetrically. Symmetrical binding occurs along the NT-3 interfaces, resulting in a 2:2 ligand-receptor cluster. A comparison of the symmetrical and asymmetric structures reveals significant differences in ligand receptor interactions and p75(NTR) conformations. Biochemical experiments indicate that both NT-3 and NGF bind to p75(NTR) with 2:2 stoichiometry in solution, whereas the 2:1 complexes are the result of artificial deglycosylation. We therefore propose that the symmetrical 2:2 complex reflects a native state of p75(NTR) activation at the cell surface. These results provide a model for NTs-p75(NTR) recognition and signal generation, as well as insights into coordination between p75(NTR) and Trks.
