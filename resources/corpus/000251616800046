The Arabidopsis circadian clock incorporates a cADPR-based feedback loop
Transcriptional feedback loops are a feature of circadian clocks in both animals and plants. We show that the plant circadian clock also incorporates the cytosolic signaling molecule cyclic adenosine diphosphate ribose (cADPR). cADPR modulates the circadian oscillator's transcriptional feedback loops and drives circadian oscillations of Ca2+ release. The effects of antagonists of cADPR signaling, manipulation of cADPR synthesis, and mathematical simulation of the interaction of cADPR with the circadian clock indicate that cADPR forms a feedback loop within the plant circadian clock.
