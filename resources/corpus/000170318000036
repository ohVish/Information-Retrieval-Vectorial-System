Vacancies in solids and the stability of surface morphology
Determining how thermal vacancies are created and destroyed in solids is crucial for understanding many of their physical properties, such as solid-state diffusion. Surfaces are known to be good sources and sinks for bulk vacancies, but directly determining where the exchange between the surface and the bulk occurs is difficult. Here we show that vacancy generation (and annihilation) on the (110) surface of an ordered nickel-aluminium intermetallic alloy does not occur over the entire surface, but only near atomic step edges. This has been determined by oscillating the sample's temperature and observing in real time the response of the surface structure as a function of frequency (a version of Angstrom's method of measuring thermal conductivity(1)) using low-energy electron microscopy. Although the surface-exchange process is slow compared with bulk diffusion, the vacancy-generation rate nevertheless controls the dynamics of the alloy surface morphology. These observations, demonstrating that surface smoothing can occur through bulk vacancy transport rather than surface diffusion, should have important implications for the stability of fabricated nanoscale structures.
