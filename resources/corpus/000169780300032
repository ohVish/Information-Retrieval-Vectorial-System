Approach to high-resolution ex situ NMR spectroscopy
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments are typically performed with samples immersed in a magnet shimmed to high homogeneity. However, there are many circumstances in which it is impractical or undesirable to insert objects or subjects into the bore of a high-field magnet. Here we present a methodology based on an adaptation of nutation echoes that provides resolved spectra in the presence of matched inhomogeneous static and radiofrequency fields, thereby opening the way to high-resolution exsitu NMR, The observation of chemical shifts is regained through the use of multiple-pulse sequences of correlated, composite z-rotation pulses, producing resolved NMR spectra of liquid samples.
