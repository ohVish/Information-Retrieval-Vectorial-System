Integrating molecular and network biology to decode endocytosis
The strength of network biology lies in its ability to derive cell biological information without a priori mechanistic or molecular knowledge. It is shown here how a careful understanding of a given biological pathway can refine an interactome approach. This permits the elucidation of additional design principles and of spatio-temporal dynamics behind pathways, and aids in experimental design and interpretation.
