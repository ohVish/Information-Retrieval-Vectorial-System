Gametes from embryonic stem cells: A cup half empty or half full?
When first reported 4 years ago, gametogenesis from embryonic stem (ES) cells promised an accessible in vitro model to facilitate molecular analysis of the germ lineage. Formation of primordial germ cells is robust, but terminal gametogenesis remains inefficient and doubts about gamete function persist. Although useful for research, clinical use of ES cell-derived gametes appears a distant prospect.
