Three-Dimensional Plasmon Rulers
Plasmon rulers can be used to determine nanoscale distances within chemical or biological species. They are based on the spectral shift of the scattering spectrum when two plasmonic nanoparticles approach one another. However, the one-dimensionality of current plasmon rulers hampers the comprehensive understanding of many intriguing processes in soft matter, which take place in three dimensions. We demonstrated a three-dimensional plasmon ruler that is based on coupled plasmonic oligomers in combination with high-resolution plasmon spectroscopy. This enables retrieval of the complete spatial configuration of complex macromolecular and biological processes as well as their dynamic evolution.
