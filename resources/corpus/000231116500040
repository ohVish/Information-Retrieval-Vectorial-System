In situ multi-satellite detection of coherent vortices as a manifestation of Alfvenic turbulence
Turbulence in fluids(1) and plasmas(2-5) is a ubiquitous phenomenon driven by a variety of sources - currents, sheared flows, gradients in density and temperature, and so on. Turbulence involves fluctuations of physical properties on many different scales, which interact nonlinearly to produce self-organized structures in the form of vortices(2-5). Vortex motion in fluids and magnetized plasmas is typically governed by nonlinear equations(2-5), examples of which include the Navier - Stokes equation(1,2), the Charney - Hasegawa - Mima equations(2-5) and their numerous generalizations(6-9). These nonlinear equations admit solutions(2-5) in the form of different types of vortices that are frequently observed in a variety of contexts: in atmospheres, in oceans and planetary systems(2,4), in the heliosphere(10,11), in the Earth's ionosphere and magnetosphere(12-17), and in laboratory plasma experiments(18). Here we report the discovery by the Cluster satellites(19) of a distinct class of vortex motion - short-scale drift-kinetic Alfven (DKA) vortices(8,9) - in the Earth's magnetospheric cusp region. As is the case for the larger Kelvin - Helmholtz vortices observed previously(17), these dynamic structures should provide a channel for transporting plasma particles and energy through the magnetospheric boundary layers.
