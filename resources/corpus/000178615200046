Probing the free-energy surface for protein folding with single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy
Protein folding is inherently a heterogeneous process because of the very large number of microscopic pathways that connect the myriad unfolded conformations to the unique conformation of the native structure. In a first step towards the long-range goal of describing the distribution of pathways experimentally, Forster resonance energy transfer(1) (FRET) has been measured on single, freely diffusing molecules(2-4). Here we use this method to determine properties of the free-energy surface for folding that have not been obtained from ensemble experiments. We show that single-molecule FRET measurements of a small cold-shock protein expose equilibrium collapse of the unfolded polypeptide and allow us to calculate limits on the polypeptide reconfiguration time. From these results, limits on the height of the free-energy barrier to folding are obtained that are consistent with a simple statistical mechanical model, but not with the barriers derived from simulations using molecular dynamics. Unlike the activation energy, the free-energy barrier includes the activation entropy and thus has been elusive to experimental determination for any kinetic process in solution.
