The semaphorin 4D receptor plexin-B1 is a GTPase activating protein for R-Ras
Plexins are cell surface receptors for semaphorin molecules, and their interaction governs cell adhesion and migration in a variety of tissues. We report that the Semaphorin 4D (Sema4D) receptor Plexin-B1 directly stimulates the intrinsic guanosine triphosphatase ( GTPase) activity of R-Ras, a member of the Ras superfamily of small GTP-binding proteins that has been implicated in promoting cell adhesion and neurite outgrowth. This activity required the interaction of Plexin-B1 with Rnd1, a small GTP-binding protein of the Rho family. Down-regulation of R-Ras activity by the Plexin-B1-Rnd1 complex was essential for the Sema4D-induced growth cone collapse in hippocampal neurons. Thus, Plexin-B1 mediates Sema4D-induced repulsive axon guidance signaling by acting as a GTPase activating protein for R-Ras.
