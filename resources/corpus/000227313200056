Evidence for a great medieval earthquake (approximate to 1100 AD) in the Central Himalayas, Nepal
The Himalayan orogen has produced three thrust earthquakes with moment magnitude (M-w) 7.8 to 8.5 during the past century, yet no surface ruptures associated with these great earthquakes have been documented. Here, we present paleoseismic evidence from east central Nepal that, since similar to700 A.D., a single earthquake ruptured the Frontal Thrust fault at similar to1100 A.D., with a surface displacement of similar to17 (+5/-3) meters and a lateral extent and size that could have exceeded 240 kilometers and similar toM(w) 8.8, respectively. Ruptures associated with M-w <8.2 events would contribute to the frontal Himalayas folding but would stop before reaching the surface. These findings could require substantial modifications to current regional seismic hazard models.
