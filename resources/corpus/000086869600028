Micropatterning of organic electronic devices by cold-welding
A simple and general postdeposition electrode patterning technique for active organic electronic devices is demonstrated and is applied to patterning the metal cathodes of organic light-emitting devices. Selective lift-off of the metal cathode layer is achieved by pressing a prepatterned, metal-coated silicon stamp on the unpatterned device layers. Under pressure, the metal coating on the stamp cold-welds to the metal cathode coating the underlying organic films. Subsequent separation of the stamp from the substrate results in removal of the cathode metal in the regions contacted by the stamp, resulting in submicrometer feature definition. A 17x17 passive matrix display, with a pixel size of 440 micrometers by 320 micrometers, was fabricated with this process. Cold-welding followed by lift-off of the cathode metal allows simple, cost-effective, and high-throughput large-area fabrication of organic electronic devices.
