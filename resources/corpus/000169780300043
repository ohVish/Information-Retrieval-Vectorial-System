Stimulation of RNA polymerase II elongation by hepatitis delta antigen
Transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) is negatively regulated by the human factors DRB-sensitivity inducing factor (DSIF) and negative elongation factor (NELF). A 66-kilodalton subunit of NELF (NELF-A) shows limited sequence similarity to hepatitis delta antigen (HDAg), the viral protein required for replication of hepatitis delta virus (HDV). The host RNAPII has been implicated in HDV replication, but the detailed mechanism and the role of HDAg in this process are not understood. We show that HDAg binds RNAPII directly and stimulates transcription by displacing NELF and promoting RNAPII elongation. These results suggest that HDAg may regulate RNAPII elongation during both cellular messenger RNA synthesis and HDV RNA replication.
