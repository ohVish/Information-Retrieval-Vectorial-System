Crystal Structure of Na+, K+-ATPase in the Na+-Bound State
The Na+, K+-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) maintains the electrochemical gradients of Na+ and K+ across the plasma membrane-a prerequisite for electrical excitability and secondary transport. Hitherto, structural information has been limited to K+-bound or ouabain-blocked forms. We present the crystal structure of a Na+-bound Na+, K+-ATPase as determined at 4.3 angstrom resolution. Compared with the K+-bound form, large conformational changes are observed in the a subunit whereas the beta and gamma subunit structures are maintained. The locations of the three Na+ sites are indicated with the unique site III at the recently suggested IIIb, as further supported by electrophysiological studies on leak currents. Extracellular release of the third Na+ from IIIb through IIIa, followed by exchange of Na+ for K+ at sites I and II, is suggested.
