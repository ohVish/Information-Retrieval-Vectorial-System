Geodetic evidence for a low slip rate in the Altyn Tagh fault system
The collision between India and Asia has been simulated with a variety of computational models that describe or predict the motions of the main faults of east Asia. Geological slip-rate estimates of 20-30 mm yr(-1) suggest that the largest of these faults, the 2,000-km-long Altyn Tagh fault system on the northern edge of the Tibetan plateau, absorbs as much of the Indo-Asian convergence signal as do the Himalayas(1,2)-partly by oblique slip and partly by contraction and mountain growth(3-5). However, the predictions of dynamic models for Asian deformation(6) and the lower bounds of some geological slip-rates estimates (3-9 mm yr(-1); refs 7, 8) suggest that the Altyn Tagh system is less active. Here, we report geodetic data from 89-91 degrees E that indicate left-lateral shear of 9 +/- 5 mm yr(-1) and contraction of 3 +/- 1 mm yr(-1) across the Altyn Tagh system, This result-combined with our finding that, at 98 degrees E, Tibet contracts north-south at 9 1 mm yr(-1)-supports the predictions of dynamic models of Asian deformation.
