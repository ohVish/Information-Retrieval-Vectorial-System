Conditional restoration of hippocampal synaptic potentiation in GluR-A-deficient mice
Plasticity of mature hippocampal CA1 synapses is dependent on L-alpha -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) receptors containing the glutamate receptor A (GLuR-A) subunit. In GLuR-A-deficient mice, plasticity could be restored by controlled expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged GluRA, which contributes to channel formation and displayed the developmental redistribution of AMPA receptors in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by pairing or tetanic stimulation was rescued in adult GluR-A(-/-) mice when (GFP)GluR-A expression was constitutive or induced in already fully developed pyramidal cells. This shows that GluR-A-independent forms of synaptic plasticity can mediate the establishment of mature hippocampal circuits that are prebuilt to express GluR-A-dependent LTP.
