Screening for nitric oxide-dependent protein-protein interactions
Because nitric oxide (NO) may be a ubiquitous regulator of cellular signaling, we have modified the yeast two-hybrid system to explore the possibility of NO-dependent protein-protein interactions. We screened for binding partners of procaspase-3, a protein implicated in apoptotic signaling pathways, and identified multiple NO-dependent interactions. Two such interactions, with acid sphingomyelinase and NO synthase, were shown to occur in mammalian cells dependent on endogenous NO. Nitrosylation may thus provide a broad-based mechanism for regulating interactions between proteins. If so, systematic proteomic analyses in which redox state and NO bioavailability are carefully controlled will reveal a large array of novel interactions.
