Spin-Light Coherence for Single-Spin Measurement and Control in Diamond
The exceptional spin coherence of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond motivates their function in emerging quantum technologies. Traditionally, the spin state of individual centers is measured optically and destructively. We demonstrate dispersive, single-spin coupling to light for both nondestructive spin measurement, through the Faraday effect, and coherent spin manipulation, through the optical Stark effect. These interactions can enable the coherent exchange of quantum information between single nitrogen-vacancy spins and light, facilitating coherent measurement, control, and entanglement that is scalable over large distances.
