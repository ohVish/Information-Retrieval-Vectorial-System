Quantum suppression of superconductivity in ultrathin nanowires
It is of fundamental importance to establish whether there is a limit to how thin a superconducting wire can be, while retaining its superconducting character-and if there is a limit, to determine what sets it. This issue may also be of practical importance in defining the limit to miniaturization of superconducting electronic circuits. At high temperatures, the resistance of linear superconductors is caused by excitations called thermally activated phase slips(1-4). Quantum tunnelling of phase slips is another possible source of resistance that is still being debated(5-8). It has been theoretically predicted(8) that such quantum phase slips can destroy superconductivity in very narrow wires. Here we report resistance measurements on ultrathin ( less than or similar to 10 nm) nanowires produced by coating carbon nanotubes with a superconducting Mo-Ge alloy. We rnd that nanowires can be superconducting or insulating depending on the ratio of their normal-state resistance (R-N) to the quantum resistance for Cooper pairs (R-q). If R-N < R-q, quantum tunnelling of phase slips is prohibited by strong damping, and so the wires stay superconducting. In contrast, we observe an insulating state for R-N > R-q, which we explain in terms of proliferation of quantum phase slips and a corresponding localization of Cooper pairs.
