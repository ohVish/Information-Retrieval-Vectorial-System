Targeting of diacylglycerol degradation to M1 muscarinic receptors by beta-arrestins
Seven-transmembrane receptor (7TMR) signaling is transduced by second messengers such as diacylglycerol (DAG) generated in response to the heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(q) and is terminated by receptor desensitization and degradation of the second messengers. We show that beta-arrestins coordinate both processes for the G(q)-coupled M1 muscarinic receptor. beta-Arrestins physically interact with diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs), enzymes that degrade DAG. Moreover, beta-arrestins are essential for conversion of DAG to phosphatidic acid after agonist stimulation, and this activity requires recruitment of the beta-arrestin-DGK complex to activated 7TMRs. The dual function of beta-arrestins, limiting production of diacylglycerol (by receptor desensitization) while enhancing its rate of degradation, is analogous to their ability to recruit adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate phosphodiesterases to G(s)-coupled beta(2)-adrenergic receptors. Thus, beta-arrestins can serve similar regulatory functions for disparate classes of 7TMRs through structurally dissimilar enzymes that degrade chemically distinct second messengers.
