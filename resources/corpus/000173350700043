Positive mass balance of the Ross Ice Streams, West Antarctica
We have used ice-flow velocity measurements from synthetic aperture radar to reassess the mass balance of the Ross Ice Streams, West Antarctica. We find strong evidence for ice-sheet growth (+ 26.8 gigatons per year), in contrast to earlier estimates indicating a mass deficit (-20.9 gigatons per year), Average thickening is equal to similar to25% of the accumulation rate, with most of this growth occurring on Ice Stream C. Whillans Ice Stream, which was thought to have a significantly negative mass balance, is close to balance, reflecting its continuing slowdown. The overall positive mass balance may signal an end to the Holocene retreat of these ice streams.
