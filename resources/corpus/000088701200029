Folds on Europa: Implications for crustal cycling and accommodation of extension
Regional-scale undulations with associated small-scale secondary structures are inferred to be folds on Jupiter's moon Europa. Formation is consistent with stresses from tidal deformation, potentially triggering compressional instability of a region of Locally high thermal gradient. Folds may compensate for extension elsewhere on Europa and then relax away over time.
