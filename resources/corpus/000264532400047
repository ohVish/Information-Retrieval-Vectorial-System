Dynamic expression of epidermal caspase 8 simulates a wound healing response
Tissue homeostasis and regeneration are regulated by an intricate balance of seemingly competing processes-proliferation versus differentiation, and cell death versus survival(1). Here we demonstrate that the loss of epidermal caspase 8, an important mediator of apoptosis(2), recapitulates several phases of a wound healing response in the mouse. The epidermal hyperplasia in the caspase 8 null skin is the culmination of signals exchanged between epidermal keratinocytes, dermal fibroblasts and leukocytic cells. This reciprocal interaction is initiated by the paracrine signalling of interleukin 1 alpha (IL1 alpha), which activates both skin stem cell proliferation and cutaneous inflammation. The non-canonical secretion of IL1a is induced by a p38-MAPK-mediated upregulation of NALP3 (also known as NLRP3), leading to inflammasome assembly and caspase 1 activation. Notably, the increased proliferation of basal keratinocytes is counterbalanced by the growth arrest of suprabasal keratinocytes in the stratified epidermis by IL1 alpha-dependent NF kappa B signalling. Altogether, our findings illustrate how the loss of caspase 8 can affect more than programmed cell death to alter the local microenvironment and elicit processes common to wound repair and many neoplastic skin disorders.
