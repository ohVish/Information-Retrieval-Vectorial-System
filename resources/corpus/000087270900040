Like attracts like: Getting RNA processing together in the nucleus
Structures visible within the eukaryotic nucleus have fascinated generations of biologists. Recent data show that these structures form in response to gene expression and are highly dynamic in Living cells. RNA processing and assembly require many factors but the nucleus apparently lacks any active transport system to deliver these to the RNAs. Instead, processing factors move by diffusion but are concentrated by transient association with functionally related components. At sites of high activity this gives rise to visible structures, with components in dynamic equilibrium with the surrounding nucleoplasm. Processing factors are recruited from this pool by cooperative binding to RNA substrates.
