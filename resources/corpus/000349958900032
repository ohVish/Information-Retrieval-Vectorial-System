Metal-free efficient photocatalyst for stable visible water splitting via a two-electron pathway
The use of solar energy to produce molecular hydrogen and oxygen (H-2 and O-2) from overall water splitting is a promising means of renewable energy storage. In the past 40 years, various inorganic and organic systems have been developed as photocatalysts for water splitting driven by visible light. These photocatalysts, however, still suffer from low quantum efficiency and/or poor stability. We report the design and fabrication of a metal-free carbon nanodot-carbon nitride (C3N4) nanocomposite and demonstrate its impressive performance for photocatalytic solar water splitting. We measured quantum efficiencies of 16% for wavelength lambda = 420 +/- 20 nanometers, 6.29% for lambda = 580 +/- 15 nanometers, and 4.42% for lambda = 600 +/- 10 nanometers, and determined an overall solar energy conversion efficiency of 2.0%. The catalyst comprises low-cost, Earth-abundant, environmentally friendly materials and shows excellent stability.
