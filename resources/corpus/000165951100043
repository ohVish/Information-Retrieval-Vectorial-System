The influence of rivers on marine boron isotopes and implications for reconstructing past ocean pH
Ocean pH is particularly sensitive to atmospheric carbon dioxide content(1-3). Records of ocean pH can therefore be used to estimate past atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. The isotopic composition of boron (delta B-11) contained in the carbonate shells of marine organisms varies according to pH, from which ocean pH can be reconstructed(4-11). This requires independent estimates of the delta B-11 of dissolved boron in sea water through time. The marine delta B-11 budget, however, is still largely unconstrained. Here we show that, by incorporating the global flux of riverine boron (as estimated from delta B-11 measurements in 22 of the world's main rivers), the marine boron isotope budget can be balanced. We also derive ocean delta B-11 budgets for the past 120 Myr. Estimated isotope compositions of boron in sea water show a remarkable consistency with records of delta B-11 in foraminiferal carbonates(9-11), suggesting that foraminifera delta B-11 records may in part reflect changes in the marine boron isotope budget rather than changes in ocean pH over the Cenozoic era.
