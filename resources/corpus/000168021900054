Chemical speciation drives hydrothermal vent ecology
The physiology and biochemistry of many taxa inhabiting deep-sea hydrothermal vents have been elucidated(1-4); however, the physicochemical factors controlling the distribution of these organisms at a given vent site remain an enigma after 20 years of research(5-11). The chemical speciation of particular elements has been suggested as key to controlling biological community structure in these extreme aquatic environments(7,11,12). Implementation of electrochemical technology(13,14) has allowed us to make in situ measurements of chemical speciation at vents located at the East Pacific Rise (9 degrees 50' N) and on a scale relevant to the biology. Here we report that significant differences in oxygen, iron and sulphur speciation strongly correlate with the distribution of specific taxa in different microhabitats. In higher temperature (>30 degreesC) microhabitats, the appreciable formation of soluble iron-sulphide molecular clusters markedly reduces the availability of free H2S/ HS- to vent (micro)organisms, thus controlling the available habitat.
