Enhanced CpG mutability and tumorigenesis in MBD4-deficient mice
The mammalian protein MBD4 contains a methyl-CpG binding domain and can enzymatically remove thymine (T) or uracil (U) from a mismatched CpG site in vitro. These properties suggest that MBD4 might function in vivo to minimize the mutability of 5-methylcytosine by removing its deamination product from DNA. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing Mbd4(-/-) mice and found that the frequency of of C 3 T transitions at CpG sites was increased by a factor of three. On a cancer-susceptible Apc(Min/+) background, Mbd4(-/-) mice showed accelerated tumor formation with CpG --> TpG mutations in the Apc gene. Thus MBD4 suppresses CpG mutability and tumorigenesis in vivo.
