Bilayer He-3: A simple two-dimensional heavy-fermion system with quantum criticality
Two-dimensional helium-3 (He-3) provides a simple model for the experimental investigation of the emergence of quantum complexity in a strongly correlated Fermi system. We have observed two-dimensional, two-band heavy-fermion behavior in bilayer films of He-3 atoms when adsorbed on the surface of graphite preplated by a solid bilayer of He-4. Thermodynamic measurements on this system showed that the relevant control parameter is the total density of the He-3 film. The He-3 bilayer system can be driven toward a quantum critical point at which the effective mass appears to diverge, interband coupling vanishes, and a local-moment state appears. It opens a new testing ground for theories of quantum criticality in heavy-fermion materials.
