Localization of long-term memory within the Drosophila mushroom body
The mushroom bodies, substructures of the Drosophila brain, are involved in olfactory learning and short-term memory, but their rote in long-term memory is unknown. Here we show that the alpha-lobes-absent (ala) mutant lacks either the two vertical lobes of the mushroom body or two of the three median lobes which contain branches of vertical lobe neurons. This unique phenotype allows analysis of mushroom body function. Long-term memory required the presence of the vertical lobes but not the median lobes. Short-term memory was normal in flies without either vertical lobes or the two median lobes studied.
