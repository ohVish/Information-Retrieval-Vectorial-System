A light-actuated nanovalve derived from a channel protein
Toward the realization of nanoscale device control, we report a molecular valve embedded in a membrane that can be opened by illumination with long-wavelength ultraviolet (366 nanometers) tight and then resealed by visible irradiation. The valve consists of a channel protein, the mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) from Escherichia coli, modified by attachment of synthetic compounds that undergo tight-induced charge separation to reversibly open and close a 3-nanometer pore. The system is compatible with a classical encapsulation system, the liposome, and external photochemical control over transport through the channel is achieved.
