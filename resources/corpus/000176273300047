Design and control of wave propagation patterns in excitable media
Intricate patterns of wave propagation are exhibited in a chemical reaction-diffusion system with spatiotemporal feedback, Wave behavior is controlled by feedback-regulated excitability gradients that guide propagation in specified directions. Waves interacting with boundaries and with other waves are observed when interaction terms are incorporated into the control algorithm. Spatiotemporal feedback offers wide flexibility for designing and controlling wave behavior in excitable media.
