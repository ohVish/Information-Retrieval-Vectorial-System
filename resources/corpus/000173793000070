Generation of an LFA-1 antagonist by the transfer of the ICAM-1 immunoregulatory epitope to a small molecule
The protein-protein interaction between leukocyte functional antigen-1 (LFA-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is critical to lymphocyte and immune system function. Here, we report on the transfer of the contiguous, nonlinear epitope of ICAM-1, responsible for its association with LFA-1, to a small-molecule framework. These LFA-1 antagonists bound LFA-1, blocked binding of ICAM-1, and inhibited a mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) with potency significantly greater than that of cyclosporine A. Furthermore, in comparison to an antibody to LFA-1, they exhibited significant anti-inflammatory effects in vivo. These results demonstrate the utility of small-molecule mimics of nonlinear protein epitopes and the protein epitopes themselves as leads in the identification of novel pharmaceutical agents.
