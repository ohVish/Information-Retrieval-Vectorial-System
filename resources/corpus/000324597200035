Teaching Metathesis "Simple" Stereochemistry
Applications of metal-catalyzed olefin metathesis reactions manifested dramatic growth during the late 20th and early 21st centuries, culminating in the 2005 Nobel Prize awarded to three of the pioneers. The standard catalysts developed during that time frame and their descendants have profoundly changed the mindset of the synthetic community, even though they do not provide a handle to control selectivity issues as fundamental as the E/Z geometry of the newly formed double bond. With yet another generation of catalysts in the making that are far superior in this regard, a new wave seems to be building up that is expected to have enormous impact, too. The current state of the art is critically assessed, as are possible alternatives such as the metathesis of triple bonds followed by stereoselective semi-reduction.
