A distinct signaling pathway used by the IgG-containing B cell antigen receptor
The immunoglobulin G (IgG)-containing B lymphocyte antigen receptor (IgG-BCR) transmits a signal distinct from that of IgM-BCR or IgD-BCR, although all three use the same signal-transducing component, Igalpha/Igbeta. Here we demonstrate that the inhibitory coreceptor CD22 down-modulates signaling through IgM-BCR and IgD-BCR, but not that through IgG-BCR, because of the IgG cytoplasmic tail, which prevents CD22 phosphorylation. These results suggest that the cytoplasmic tail of IgG specifically enhances IgG-BCR signaling by preventing CD22-mediated signal inhibition. Enhanced signaling through IgG-BCR may be involved in efficient IgG production, which is crucial for immunity to pathogens.
