Accelerated intestinal epithelial cell turnover: A new mechanism of parasite expulsion
The functional integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier forms a major defense against invading pathogens, including gastrointestinal-dwelting nematodes, which are ubiquitous in their distribution worldwide. Here, we show that an increase in the rate of epithelial. cell turnover in the large intestine acts like an "epithelia[ escalator" to expel Trichuris and that the rate of epithelial cell movement is under immune control by the cytokine interieukin-13 and the chemokine CXCL10. This host protective mechanism against intestinal pathogens has implications for our wider understanding of the multifunctional role played by intestinal epithelium in mucosal defense.
