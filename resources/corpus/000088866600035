Forming electrical networks in three dimensions by self-assembly
Self-assembly of millimeter-scale polyhedra, with surfaces patterned with solder dots, wires, and light-emitting diodes, generated electrically functional, three-dimensional networks. The patterns of dots and wires controlled the structure of the networks formed; both parallel and serial connections were generated.
