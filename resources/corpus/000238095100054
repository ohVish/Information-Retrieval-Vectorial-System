Importance of SoxE in neural crest development and the evolution of the pharynx
The neural crest, a defining character of vertebrates(1), is of prime importance to their evolutionary origin(2). To understand neural crest evolution, we explored molecular mechanisms underlying craniofacial development in the basal jawless vertebrate, sea lamprey ( Petromyzon marinus), focusing on the SoxE ( Sox8, Sox9 and Sox10) gene family. In jawed vertebrates, these are important transcriptional regulators of the neural crest(3), and the loss of Sox9 causes abnormal craniofacial development(4,5). Here we report that two lamprey SoxE genes are expressed in migrating neural crest and crest-derived prechondrocytes in posterior branchial arches, whereas a third paralogue is expressed later in the perichondrium and mandibular arch. Morpholino knock-down of SoxE1 reveals that it is essential for posterior branchial arch development, although the mandibular arch is unaffected. The results show that chondrogenic function of SoxE regulators can be traced to the lamprey-gnathostome common ancestor and indicate that lamprey SoxE genes might have undergone independent duplication to have distinct functions in mandibular versus caudal branchial arches. This work sheds light on the homology of vertebrate branchial arches and supports their common origin at the base of vertebrates.
