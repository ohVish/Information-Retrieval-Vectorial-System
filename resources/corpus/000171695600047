Integration between the epibranchial placodes and the hindbrain
Developmental integration results from coordination among components of different embryonic fields to realize the later anatomical and functional relationships. We demonstrate that in the chick head, integration between the epibranchial placodes and the hindbrain is achieved as the neuroglial hindbrain crest cells guide the epibranchial neuronal. cells inward to establish their central connections. This work defines a role for the neuroglial hindbrain crest in organizing the afferent innervation of the hindbrain.
