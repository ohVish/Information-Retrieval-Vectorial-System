Interferon-lambda cures persistent murine norovirus infection in the absence of adaptive immunity
Norovirus gastroenteritis is a major public health burden worldwide. Although fecal shedding is important for transmission of enteric viruses, little is known about the immune factors that restrict persistent enteric infection. We report here that although the cytokines interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) and IFN-beta prevented the systemic spread of murine norovirus (MNoV), only IFN-lambda controlled persistent enteric infection. Infection-dependent induction of IFN-lambda was governed by the MNoV capsid protein and correlated with diminished enteric persistence. Treatment of established infection with IFN-lambda cured mice in a manner requiring nonhematopoietic cell expression of the IFN-lambda receptor, Ifnlr1, and independent of adaptive immunity. These results suggest the therapeutic potential of IFN-lambda for curing virus infections in the gastrointestinal tract.
