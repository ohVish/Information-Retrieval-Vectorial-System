Pig cloning by microinjection of fetal fibroblast nuclei
Pig cloning will have a marked impact on the optimization of meat production and xenotransplantation. To clone pigs from differentiated cells, we microinjected the nuclei of porcine (Sus scrofa) fetal fibroblasts into enucleated oocytes, and development was induced by electroactivation. The transfer of 110 cloned embryos to four surrogate mothers produced an apparently normal female piglet. The clonal provenance of the piglet was indicated by her coat color and confirmed by DNA microsatellite analysis.
