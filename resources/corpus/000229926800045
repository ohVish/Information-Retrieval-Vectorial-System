Late Bronze Age glass production at Qantir-Piramesses, Egypt
It has been uncertain whether the glass produced during the Late Bronze Age (LBA) originated in Egypt or Mesopotamia. Here we present evidence for the production of glass from its raw materials in the eastern Nile Delta during the LBA. Glass was made in workshops that were separate from where the production of objects took place. The initial melting of the raw materials to semi-finished glass was done at temperatures of 900 degrees to 950 degrees C, followed by coloration and ingot production at 1000 degrees to 1100 degrees C.
