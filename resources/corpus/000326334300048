Pacific Ocean Heat Content During the Past 10,000 Years
Observed increases in ocean heat content (OHC) and temperature are robust indicators of global warming during the past several decades. We used high-resolution proxy records from sediment cores to extend these observations in the Pacific 10,000 years beyond the instrumental record. We show that water masses linked to North Pacific and Antarctic intermediate waters were warmer by 2.1 +/- 0.4 degrees C and 1.5 +/- 0.4 degrees C, respectively, during the middle Holocene Thermal Maximum than over the past century. Both water masses were similar to 0.9 degrees C warmer during the Medieval Warm period than during the Little Ice Age and similar to 0.65 degrees warmer than in recent decades. Although documented changes in global surface temperatures during the Holocene and Common era are relatively small, the concomitant changes in OHC are large.
