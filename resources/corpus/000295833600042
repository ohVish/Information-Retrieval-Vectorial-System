Linear Alkane Polymerization on a Gold Surface
In contrast to the many methods of selectively coupling olefins, few protocols catenate saturated hydrocarbons in a predictable manner. We report here the highly selective carbon-hydrogen (C-H) activation and subsequent dehydrogenative C-C coupling reaction of long-chain (>C(20)) linear alkanes on an anisotropic gold(110) surface, which undergoes an appropriate reconstruction by adsorption of the molecules and subsequent mild annealing, resulting in nanometer-sized channels (1.22 nanometers in width). Owing to the orientational constraint of the reactant molecules in these one-dimensional channels, the reaction takes place exclusively at specific sites (terminal CH(3) or penultimate CH(2) groups) in the chains at intermediate temperatures (420 to 470 kelvin) and selects for aliphatic over aromatic C-H activation.
