Kinesin superfamily motor protein KIF17 and mLin-10 in NMDA receptor - Containing vesicle transport
Experiments with vesicles containing N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor 2B (NR2B subunit) show that they are transported along microtubules by KIF17, a neuron-specific molecular motor in neuronal dendrites. Selective transport is accomplished by direct interaction of the KIF17 tail with a PDZ domain of mLin-10 (Mintl1/X11), which is a constituent of a large protein complex including mLin-2 (CASK), mLin-7 (MALS/VeLis), and the NR2B subunit. This interaction, specific for a neurotransmitter receptor critically important for plasticity in the postsynaptic terminal, may be a regulatory point for synaptic plasticity and neuronal morphogenesis.
