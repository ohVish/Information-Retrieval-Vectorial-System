The end of the beginning for pluripotent stem cells
Pluripotent stem cells can be expanded seemingly indefinitely in culture, maintain a normal karyotype and have the potential to generate any cell type in the body. As such they represent an incredible resource for the repair of diseased or damaged tissues in our bodies. These cells also promise to open a new window into the embryonic development of our species.
