Templating organic semiconductors via self-assembly of polymer colloids
A route for producing semiconducting polymer blends is demonstrated in which a doped pi-conjugated polymer is forced into a three-dimensionally continuous minor phase by the self-assembly of colloidal particles and block copolymers. The resulting cellular morphology can be viewed as a high-internal phase polymeric emulsion. Compared with traditional blending procedures, this process reduces the percolation threshold for electrical conductivity by a factor of 10, increases the conductivity by several orders of magnitude, and simultaneously improves thermal stability. Following this route, new applications can be envisaged for semiconducting polymer blends that require only minimal concentrations of doped pi-conjugated polymer.
