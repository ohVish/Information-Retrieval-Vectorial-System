The U/Th production ratio and the age of the Milky Way from meteorites and Galactic halo stars
Some heavy elements ( with atomic number A > 69) are produced by the 'rapid' (r)-process of nucleosynthesis, where lighter elements are bombarded with a massive flux of neutrons(1-8). Although this is characteristic of supernovae and neutron star mergers, uncertainties in where the r-process occurs persist because stellar models are too crude to allow precise quantification of this phenomenon. As a result, there are many uncertainties and assumptions in the models used to calculate the production ratios of actinides ( like uranium-238 and thorium-232). Current estimates of the U/Th production ratio range from similar to 0.4 to 0.7. Here I show that the U/Th abundance ratio in meteorites(9) can be used, in conjunction with observations of low-metallicity stars in the halo of the Milky Way(10-12), to determine the U/Th production ratio very precisely (0.571(-0.031)(+0.037)). This value can be used in future studies to constrain the possible nuclear mass formulae used in r- process calculations(5,6), to help determine the source of Galactic cosmic rays, and to date circumstellar grains(5). I also estimate the age of the Milky Way (14.5(-2.2)(+2.8) Gyr) in a way that is independent of the uncertainties associated with fluctuations in the microwave background(13) or models of stellar evolution(14,15).
