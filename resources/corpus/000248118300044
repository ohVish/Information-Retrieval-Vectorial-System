Building a behemoth
The Large Hadron Collider makes extensive use of existing CERN infrastructure but is in many respects an unprecedented undertaking. It is a proton-proton collider; therefore, it requires two separate accelerator rings with magnetic fields of opposite polarity to guide the two beams in opposite directions around its 27-km circumference. In addition, the extraordinary energies and collision rates that it has been designed to attain pose huge challenges for controlling the beam and protecting the accelerator.
