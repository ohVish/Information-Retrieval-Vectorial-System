An X-ray-emitting blast wave from the recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi
Stellar explosions such as novae and supernovae produce most of the heavy elements in the Universe. The onset of a nova is well understood(1) as driven by runaway thermonuclear fusion reactions on the surface of a white dwarf in a binary star system; but the structure, dynamics and mass of the ejecta are not well known. In rare cases, the white dwarf is embedded in the wind nebula of a red-giant companion, and the explosion products plough through the nebula and produce X-ray emission. Here we report X-ray observations of such an event, from the eruption of the recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi(2,3). The hard X-ray emission from RS Ophiuchi early in the eruption emanates from behind a blast wave, or outward-moving shock wave, that expanded freely for less than 2 days and then decelerated owing to interaction with the nebula. The X-rays faded rapidly, suggesting that the blast wave deviates from the standard spherical shell structure(4-6). The early onset of deceleration indicates that the ejected shell had a low mass, the white dwarf has a high mass(7), and that RS Ophiuchi is therefore a progenitor of the type of supernova ( type Ia) integral to studies of the expansion of the Universe.
