Structure-based carbon nanotube sorting by sequence-dependent DNA assembly
Wrapping of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) was found to be sequence-dependent. A systematic search of the ssDNA library selected a sequence d(GT) n, n = 10 to 45 that self-assembles into a helical structure around individual nanotubes in such a way that the electrostatics of the DNA-CNT hybrid depends on tube diameter and electronic properties, enabling nanotube separation by anion exchange chromatography. Optical absorption and Raman spectroscopy show that early fractions are enriched in the smaller diameter and metallic tubes, whereas late fractions are enriched in the larger diameter and semiconducting tubes.
