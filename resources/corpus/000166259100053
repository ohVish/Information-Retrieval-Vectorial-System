Differential shunting of EPSPs by action potentials
Neurons encode information and communicate via action potentials, which are generated following the summation of synaptic events. It is commonly assumed that action potentials reset the membrane potential completely, allowing another round of synaptic integration to begin. We show here that the conductances underlying the action potential act instead as a variable reset of synaptic integration. The strength of this reset is cell type-specific and depends on the kinetics, Location, and timing of the synaptic input. As a consequence, distal synapses. as well as inputs mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation, can contribute disproportionately to synaptic integration during action potential firing.
