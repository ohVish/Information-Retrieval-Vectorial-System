Applying mouse complex-trait resources to behavioural genetics
Studies of the genetic basis of behaviour in mice are at a turning point. Soon, new resources will enable the behavioural function of all genes to be tested and the networks of genes, messenger RNAs and proteins involved in a particular behaviour to be identified. Using these resources, scientists will be able to analyse mouse behaviour at an unprecedented level of detail. Interpreting the new data, however, will require a shift in focus from gene- based approaches to network- based approaches.
