The role of interstitial sites in the Ti3d defect state in the band gap of Titania
Titanium dioxide ( TiO(2)) has a number of uses in catalysis, photochemistry, and sensing that are linked to the reducibility of the oxide. Usually, bridging oxygen ( O(br)) vacancies are assumed to cause the Ti3d defect state in the band gap of rutile TiO(2)( 110). From high- resolution scanning tunneling microscopy and photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, we propose that Ti interstitials in the near- surface region may be largely responsible for the defect state in the band gap. We argue that these donor- specific sites play a key role in and may dictate the ensuing surface chemistry, such as providing the electronic charge required for O(2) adsorption and dissociation. Specifically, we identified a second O(2) dissociation channel that occurs within the Ti troughs in addition to the O(2) dissociation channel in O(br) vacancies. Comprehensive density functional theory calculations support these experimental observations.
