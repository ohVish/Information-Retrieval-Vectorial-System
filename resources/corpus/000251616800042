Serine-7 of the RNA polymerase IICTD is specifically required for snRNA gene expression
RNA polymerase II ( Pol II) transcribes genes that encode proteins and noncoding small nuclear RNAs ( snRNAs). The carboxyl- terminal repeat domain ( CTD) of the largest subunit of mammalian RNA Pol II, comprising tandem repeats of the heptapeptide consensus Tyr(1)-Ser(2)-Pro(3)Thr(4)- Ser(5)-Pro(6)-Ser(7), is required for expression of both gene types. We show that mutation of serine-7 to alanine causes a specific defect in snRNA gene expression. We also present evidence that phosphorylation of serine-7 facilitates interaction with the snRNA gene- specific Integrator complex. These findings assign a biological function to this amino acid and highlight a gene type-specific requirement for a residue within the CTD heptapeptide, supporting the existence of a CTD code.
