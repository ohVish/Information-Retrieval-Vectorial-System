Pathogenic strategies of enteric bacteria
Enteric bacteria use a limited array of macromolecular systems to implement diverse pathogenic strategies. The cellular targets of several enteric virulence factors have recently been identified. The themes that have emerged from these studies include the exploitation of molecules that regulate the actin cytoskeleton and the activation of apoptotic pathways to serve the pathogen.
