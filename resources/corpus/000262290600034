Self-Organization of a Mesoscale Bristle into Ordered, Hierarchical Helical Assemblies
Mesoscale hierarchical helical structures with diverse functions are abundant in nature. Here we show how spontaneous helicity can be induced in a synthetic polymeric nanobristle assembling in an evaporating liquid. We use a simple theoretical model to characterize the geometry, stiffness, and surface properties of the pillars that favor the adhesive self- organization of bundles with pillars wound around each other. The process can be controlled to yield highly ordered helical clusters with a unique structural hierarchy that arises from the sequential assembly of self- similar coiled building blocks over multiple length scales. We demonstrate their function in the context of self- assembly into previously unseen structures with uniform, periodic patterns and controlled handedness and as an efficient particle- trapping and adhesive system.
