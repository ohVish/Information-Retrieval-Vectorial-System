Motion integration and postdiction in visual awareness
In the flash-lag illusion, a flash and a moving object in the same Location appear to be offset. A series of psychophysical experiments yields data inconsistent with two previously proposed explanations: motion extrapolation (a predictive model) and latency difference (an online model). We propose an alternative in which visual awareness is neither predictive nor online but is postdictive, so that the percept attributed to the time of the flash is a function of events that happen in the similar to 80 milliseconds after the flash. The results here show how interpolation of the past is the only framework of the three models that provides a unified explanation for the flash-lag phenomenon.
