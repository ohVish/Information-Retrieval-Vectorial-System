Challenges and successes in developing new therapies for hepatitis C
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) will continue to be a serious global health threat for many years to come because of the chronic nature of the infection, its high prevalence and the significant morbidity of the resulting disease. Recently, a small number of molecules have produced encouraging results in proof-of-concept clinical trials. At the same time, preclinical evidence is accumulating that development of resistance will eventually limit the efficacy of new drugs. Thus, combinations of multiple agents will be required to treat chronic HCV infection.
