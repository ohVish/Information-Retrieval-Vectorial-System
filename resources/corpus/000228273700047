Formation of a carbon-carbon triple bond by coupling reactions in aqueous solution
Formation of a carbon-carbon triple bond by coupling reactions usually takes place at high temperatures, in anhydrous media and anaerobic conditions. We describe the formation of a carbon-carbon triple bond at room temperature in an aqueous solution exposed to the atmosphere. Two ethylidyne ligands of a trimolybdenum cluster coupled spontaneously to form 2-butyne. This unexpected result demonstrates the plausibility of alkylidyne chain lengthening and metathesis processes under ambient, environmentally friendly conditions.
