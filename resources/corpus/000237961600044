Mass and local topography measurements of Itokawa by Hayabusa
The ranging instrument aboard the Hayabusa spacecraft measured the surface topography of asteroid 25143 Itokawa and its mass. A typical rough area is similar in roughness to debris located on the interior wall of a large crater on asteroid 433 Eros, which suggests a surface structure on Itokawa similar to crater ejecta on Eros. The mass of Itokawa was estimated as (3.58 +/- 0.18) x 1010 kilograms, implying a bulk density of (1.95 +/- 0.14) grams per cubic centimeter for a volume of ( 1.84 +/- 0.09) x 10(7) cubic meters and a bulk porosity of similar to 40%, which is similar to that of angular sands, when assuming an LL ( low iron chondritic) meteorite composition. Combined with surface observations, these data indicate that Itokawa is the first subkilometer-sized small asteroid showing a rubble-pile body rather than a solid monolithic asteroid.
