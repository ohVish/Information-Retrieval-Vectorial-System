Ammonia channel couples glutaminase with transamidase reactions in GatCAB
The formation of glutaminyl. transfer RNA (Gln-tRNA(Gln)) differs among the three domains of life. Most bacteria employ an indirect pathway to produce Gln-tRNA(Gln) by a heterotrimeric glutamine amidotransferase CAB (GatCAB) that acts on the misacylated Glu-tRNA(Gln). Here, we describe a series of crystal structures of intact GatCAB from Staphylococcus aureus in the apo form and in the complexes with glutamine, asparagine, Mn2+, and adenosine triphosphate analog. Two identified catalytic centers for the glutaminase and transamidase reactions are markedly distant but connected by a hydrophilic ammonia channel 30 angstrom in length. Further, we show that the first U-A base pair in the acceptor stem and the D loop of tRNA(Gln) serve as identity elements essential for discrimination by GatCAB and propose a complete model for the overall concerted reactions to synthesize Gin-tRNA(Gln).
