Synaptic changes in layer 2/3 underlying map plasticity of developing barrel cortex (Retracted article. See vol 306, pg. 54, 2004)
The functional and anatomical rearrangements of cortical sensory maps accompanying changes in experience are not well understood. We examined in vivo and in vitro how the sensory map and underlying synaptic connectivity of the developing rat barrel cortex are altered when the sensory input to the cortex is partially deprived. In the nondeprived cortex, both the sensory responses and synaptic connectivity between columns were strengthened through an increase in the synaptic connection probability between L2/3 pyramids in adjacent columns. This was accompanied by a selective growth of L2/3 pyramid axonal arbors between spared columns. In contrast, deprived and nondeprived cortical columns became weakly connected in their L2/3 pyramid connections.
