CRL4 Complex Regulates Mammalian Oocyte Survival and Reprogramming by Activation of TET Proteins
The duration of a woman's reproductive period is determined by the size and persistence of a dormant oocyte pool. Specific oocyte genes are essential for follicle maintenance and female fertility. The mechanisms that regulate the expression of these genes are poorly understood. We found that a cullin-ring finger ligase-4 (CRL4) complex was crucial in this process. Oocyte-specific deletion of the CRL4 linker protein DDB1 or its substrate adaptor VPRBP (also known as DCAF1) caused rapid oocyte loss, premature ovarian insufficiency, and silencing of fertility maintaining genes. CRL4(VPRBP) activates the TET methylcytosine dioxygenases, which are involved in female germ cell development and zygote genome reprogramming. Hence, CRL4(VPRBP) ubiquitin ligase is a guardian of female reproductive life in germ cells and a maternal reprogramming factor after fertilization.
