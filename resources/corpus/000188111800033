An ion balance for ultra-high-precision atomic mass measurements
We have developed the analog of a double-pan balance for determining the masses of single molecular ions from the ratio of their two cyclotron frequencies. By con. ning two different ions on the same magnetron orbit in a Penning trap, we balance out many sources of noise and error ( such as fluctuations of the magnetic field). To minimize the systematic error associated with the Coulomb interaction between the two ions, they are kept about 1 millimeter apart from each other, resulting in fractional uncertainty below 1 x 10(-11). Such precision opens the door to numerous applications of mass spectrometry, including metrology, fundamental physics, and weighing chemical bonds.
