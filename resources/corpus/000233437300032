Exploring and engineering the cell surface interface
Cells are inherently sensitive to local mesoscale, microscale, and nanoscale patterns of chemistry and topography. We review current approaches to control cell behavior through the nanoscale engineering of materials surfaces. Far-reaching implications are emerging for applications including medical implants, cell supports, and materials that can be used as instructive three-dimensional environments for tissue regeneration.
