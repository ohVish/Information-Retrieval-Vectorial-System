Microscopic dynamics of liquid aluminum oxide
Collective excitations have been observed in liquid aluminum oxide at high temperatures by combining a containerless sample environment with inelastic x-ray scattering. The excitation spectra show a well-defined triplet peak structure at lower wave vectors Q (1 to 6 nanometers(-1)) and a single quasi-elastic peak at higher Q. The high-Q spectra are well described by kinetic theory. The low-Q spectra require a frequency-dependent viscosity and provide previously unknown experimental constraints on the behavior of liquids at the interface between atomistic and continuum theory.
