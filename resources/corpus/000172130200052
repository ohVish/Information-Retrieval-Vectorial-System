Mapping of contralateral space in retinotopic coordinates by a parietal cortical area in humans
The internal organization of a higher level visual area in the human parietal cortex was mapped. Functional magnetic resonance images were acquired while the polar angle of a peripheral target for a delayed saccade was gradually changed. A region in the superior parietal cortex showed robust retinotopic mapping of the remembered target angle. The map reversed when the direction of rotation of the remembered targets was reversed and persisted unchanged when study participants detected rare target reappearances while maintaining fixation, or when the eccentricity of successive remembered targets was unpredictable. This region may correspond to the lateral intraparietal area in macaque monkeys.
