Alkali-Stabilized Pt-OHx Species Catalyze Low-Temperature Water-Gas Shift Reactions
We report that alkali ions (sodium or potassium) added in small amounts activate platinum adsorbed on alumina or silica for the low-temperature water-gas shift (WGS) reaction (H2O + CO -> H-2 + CO2) used for producing H2. The alkali ion-associated surface OH groups are activated by CO at low temperatures (similar to 100 degrees C) in the presence of atomically dispersed platinum. Both experimental evidence and density functional theory calculations suggest that a partially oxidized Pt-alkali-O-x(OH)(y) species is the active site for the low-temperature Pt-catalyzed WGS reaction. These findings are useful for the design of highly active and stable WGS catalysts that contain only trace amounts of a precious metal without the need for a reducible oxide support such as ceria.
