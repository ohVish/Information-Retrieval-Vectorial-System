The global distribution of pure anorthosite on the Moon
It has been thought that the lunar highland crust was formed by the crystallization and floatation of plagioclase from a global magma ocean(1,2), although the actual generation mechanisms are still debated(2,3). The composition of the lunar highland crust is therefore important for understanding the formation of such a magma ocean and the subsequent evolution of the Moon. The Multiband Imager(4) on the Selenological and Engineering Explorer (SELENE)(5) has a high spatial resolution of optimized spectral coverage, which should allow a clear view of the composition of the lunar crust. Here we report the global distribution of rocks of high plagioclase abundance ( approaching 100 vol.%), using an unambiguous plagioclase absorption band recorded by the SELENE Multiband Imager. If the upper crust indeed consists of nearly 100 vol.% plagioclase, this is significantly higher than previous estimates of 82-92 vol.% (refs 2, 6, 7), providing a valuable constraint on models of lunar magma ocean evolution.
