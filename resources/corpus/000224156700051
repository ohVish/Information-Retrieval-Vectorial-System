Structural basis for packaging the dimeric genome of Moloney murine leukaemia virus
All retroviruses specifically package two copies of their genomes during virus assembly, a requirement for strand-transfer-mediated recombination during reverse transcription(1,2). Genomic RNA exists in virions as dimers, and the overlap of RNA elements that promote dimerization and encapsidation suggests that these processes may be coupled(3-5). Both processes are mediated by the nucleocapsid domain (NC) of the retroviral Gag polyprotein(3). Here we show that dimerization-induced register shifts in base pairing within the Psi-RNA packaging signal of Moloney murine leukaemia virus (MoMuLV) expose conserved UCUG elements that bind NC with high affinity ( dissociation constant = 75 +/- 12 nM). These elements are base-paired and do not bind NC in the monomeric RNA. The structure of the NC complex with a 101-nucleotide 'core encapsidation' segment of the MoMuLV Psi site(6) reveals a network of interactions that promote sequence- and structure-specific binding by NC's single CCHC zinc knuckle. Our findings support a structural RNA switch mechanism for genome encapsidation, in which protein binding sites are sequestered by base pairing in the monomeric RNA and become exposed upon dimerization to promote packaging of a diploid genome.
