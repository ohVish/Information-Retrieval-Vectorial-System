Existence of an O-16-rich gaseous reservoir in the solar nebula
Carbonaceous chondrite condensate olivine grains from two distinct petrographic settings, calcium-aluminum-rich inclusion (CAI) accretionary rims and amoeboid olivine aggregates (AOAs), are oxygen-16 (O-16) enriched at the level, previously observed inside CAIs. This requires that the gas in the nebular region where these grains condensed was O-16-rich. This contrasts with an O-16-poor gas present during the formation of chondrules, suggesting that CAIs and AOAs formed in a spatially restricted region of the solar nebula containing O-16-rich gas. The O-16-rich gas composition may have resulted either from mass-independent isotopic chemistry or from evaporation of regions with enhanced dust/gas ratios, possibly in an X-wind environment near the young Sun.
