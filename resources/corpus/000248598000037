JAZ repressor proteins are targets of the SCFCO11 complex during jasmonate signalling
Jasmonate and related signalling compounds have a crucial role in both host immunity and development in plants, but the molecular details of the signalling mechanism are poorly understood. Here we identify members of the jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) protein family as key regulators of jasmonate signalling. JAZ1 protein acts to repress transcription of jasmonate-responsive genes. Jasmonate treatment causes JAZ1 degradation and this degradation is dependent on activities of the SCFCOI1 ubiquitin ligase and the 26S proteasome. Furthermore, the jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile) conjugate, but not other jasmonate-derivatives such as jasmonate, 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid, or methyl-jasmonate, promotes physical interaction between COI1 and JAZ1 proteins in the absence of other plant proteins. Our results suggest a model in which jasmonate ligands promote the binding of the SCF COI1 ubiquitin ligase to and subsequent degradation of the JAZ1 repressor protein, and implicate the SCFCOI1-JAZ1 protein complex as a site of perception of the plant hormone JA-Ile.
