Recognition and rejection of self in plant reproduction
Plant self-incompatibility (SI) systems are unique among self/nonself recognition systems in being based on the recognition of self rather than nonself. SI in crucifer species is controlled by highly polymorphic and co-evolving genes linked in a complex. Self recognition is based on allele-specific interactions between stigma receptors and pollen ligands that result in the arrest of pollen tube development. Commonalities and differences between SI and other self/nonself discrimination systems are discussed.
