Collection, mapping, and annotation of over 28,000 cDNA clones from japonica rice
We collected and completely sequenced 28,469 full-length complementary DNA clones from Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare. Through homology searches of publicly available sequence data, we assigned tentative protein functions to 21,596 clones (75.86%). Mapping of the cDNA clones to genomic DNA revealed that there are 19,000 to 20,500 transcription units in the rice genome. Protein informatics analysis against the InterPro database revealed the existence of proteins presented in rice but not in Arabidopsis. Sixty-four percent of our cDNAs are homologous to Arabidopsis proteins.
