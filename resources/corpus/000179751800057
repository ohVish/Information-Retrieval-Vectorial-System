The Molecule Pages database
The Alliance for Cellular Signaling (AfCS)-Nature Molecule Pages will be a comprehensive database of key facts about more than 3,000 proteins involved in cell signalling. Each entry will be created by invited experts and be peer-reviewed. Alongside the large-scale experiments being conducted by the AfCS scientists, the wealth of information contained in this database offers the potential of accelerating the pace of discovery in signal transduction research.
