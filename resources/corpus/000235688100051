Dendritic cell apoptosis in the maintenance of immune tolerance
Apoptosis in the immune system is critical for maintaining self-tolerance and preventing autoimmunity. Nevertheless, inhibiting apoptosis in lymphocytes is not alone sufficient to break self-tolerance, suggesting the involvement of other cell types. We investigated whether apoptosis in dendritic cells (DCs) helps regulate self-tolerance by generating transgenic mice expressing the baculoviral caspase inhibitor, p35, in DCs (DC-p35). DC-p35 mice displayed defective DC apoptosis, resulting in their accumulation and, in turn, chronic lymphocyte activation and systemic autoimmune manifestations. The observation that a defect in DC apoptosis can independently lead to autoimmunity is consistent with a central rote for these cells in maintaining immune self-tolerance.
