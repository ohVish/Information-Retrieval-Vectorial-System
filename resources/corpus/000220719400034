Bacterial invasion: The paradigms of enteroinvasive pathogens
Invasive bacteria actively induce their own uptake by phagocytosis in normally nonphagocytic cells and then either establish a protected niche within which they survive and replicate, or disseminate from cell to cell by means of an actin-based motility process. The mechanisms underlying bacterial entry, phagosome maturation, and dissemination reveal common strategies as well as unique tactics evolved by individual species to establish infection.
