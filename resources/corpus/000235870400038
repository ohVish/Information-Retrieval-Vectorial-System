Synthesis and characterization of the nitrides of platinum and iridium
Transition metal nitrides are of great technological and fundamental importance because of their strength and durability and because of their useful optical, electronic, and magnetic properties. We have evaluated a recently synthesized platinum nitride (PtN) that was shown to have a large bulk modulus, and we propose a structure that is isostructural with pyrite and has the stoichiometry PtN2. We have also synthesized a recoverable nitride of iridium under nearly the same conditions of pressure and temperature as PtN2. Although it has the same stoichiometry, it exhibits much lower structural symmetry. Preliminary results suggest that the bulk modulus of this material is also very large.
