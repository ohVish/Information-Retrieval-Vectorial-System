Structure of class B GPCR corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1
Structural analysis of class B G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), cell-surface proteins that respond to peptide hormones, has been restricted to the amino-terminal extracellular domain, thus providing little understanding of the membrane-spanning signal transduction domain. The corticotropin-releasing factor receptor type 1 is a class B receptor which mediates the response to stress and has been considered a drug target for depression and anxiety. Here we report the crystal structure of the transmembrane domain of the human corticotropin-releasing factor receptor type 1 incomplex with the small-molecule antagonist CP-376395. The structure provides detailed insight into the architecture of class B receptors. Atomic details of the interactions of the receptor with the non-peptide ligand that binds deep within the receptor are described. This structure provides a model for all class B GPCRs and may aid in the design of new small-molecule drugs for diseases of brain and metabolism.
