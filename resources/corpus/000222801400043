Conceptual precursors to language
Because human languages vary in sound and meaning, children must learn which distinctions their language uses. For speech perception, this learning is selective: initially infants are sensitive to most acoustic distinctions used in any language(1-3), and this sensitivity reflects basic properties of the auditory system rather than mechanisms specific to language(4-7); however, infants' sensitivity to non-native sound distinctions declines over the course of the first year(8). Here we ask whether a similar process governs learning of word meanings. We investigated the sensitivity of 5-month-old infants in an English-speaking environment to a conceptual distinction that is marked in Korean but not English; that is, the distinction between 'tight' and 'loose' fit of one object to another(9,10). Like adult Korean speakers but unlike adult English speakers, these infants detected this distinction and divided a continuum of motion-into-contact actions into tight- and loose-fit categories. Infants' sensitivity to this distinction is linked to representations of object mechanics(11) that are shared by non-human animals(12-14). Language learning therefore seems to develop by linking linguistic forms to universal, pre-existing representations of sound and meaning.
