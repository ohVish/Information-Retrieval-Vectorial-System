Visualization and spectroscopy of a metal-molecule-metal bridge
Artificial nanostructures, each composed of a copper(II) phthalocyanine (CuPc) molecule bonded to two gold atomic chains with a controlled gap, were assembled on a NiAl(110) surface by manipulation of individual gold atoms and CuPc molecules with a scanning tunneling microscope. The electronic densities of states of these hybrid structures were measured by spatially resolved electronic spectroscopy and systematically tuned by varying the number of gold atoms in the chains one by one. The present approach provides structural images and electronic characterization of the metal-molecule-metal junction, thereby elucidating the nature of the contacts between the molecule and metal in this junction.
