Evidence for an ancient martian ocean in the topography of deformed shorelines
A suite of observations suggests that the northern plains of Mars, which cover nearly one third of the planet's surface, may once have contained an ocean(1-7). Perhaps the most provocative evidence for an ancient ocean is a set of surface features that ring the plains for thousands of kilometres and that have been interpreted as a series of palaeoshorelines of different age(1,7). It has been shown, however, that topographic profiles along the putative shorelines contain long-wavelength trends with amplitudes of up to several kilometres(4,5,8), and these trends have been taken as an argument against the martian shoreline ( and ocean) hypothesis(8). Here we show that the long-wavelength topography of the shorelines is consistent with deformation caused by true polar wander - a change in the orientation of a planet with respect to its rotation pole - and that the inferred pole path has the geometry expected for a true polar wander event that postdates the formation of the massive Tharsis volcanic rise.
