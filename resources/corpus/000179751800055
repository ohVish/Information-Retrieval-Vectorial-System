Unravelling the signal-transduction network in B lymphocytes
The Alliance for Cellular Signaling has chosen the mouse B lymphocyte as a model system to understand basic principles that govern cellular signalling. Progress to that end has focused initially on establishing a reproducible experimental cell system and characterizing essential signalling responses. Although unravelling this complex network will take years, findings revealed in the interim will prove immensely useful to the scientific community at large.
