Translating stem and progenitor cell biology to the clinic: Barriers and opportunities
Stem cells are the natural units of embryonic generation, and also adult regeneration, of a variety of tissues. Recently, the List of tissues that use the model of differentiation from stem to progenitor to mature cell has increased from blood to include a variety of tissues, including both central and peripheral nervous systems and skeletal muscle; it is also possible that all organs and tissues are derived from, and still contain, stem cells. Because the number and activities of stem cells and their progeny are homeostatically regulated, clinical stem cell transplantation could greatly add to the physician's armamentarium against degenerative diseases.
