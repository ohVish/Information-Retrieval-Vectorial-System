Cross-species interactions between malaria parasites in humans
The dynamics of multiple Plasmodium infections in asymptomatic children Living under intense malaria transmission pressure provide evidence for a density-dependent regulation that transcends species as well as genotype. This regulation, in combination with species- and genotype-specific immune responses, results in nonindependent, sequential episodes of infection with each species.
