Role of cholesterol and lipid organization in disease
Membrane lipids are essential for biological functions ranging from membrane trafficking to signal transduction. The composition of lipid membranes influences their organization and properties, so it is not surprising that disorders in lipid metabolism and transport have a role in human disease. Significant recent progress has enhanced our understanding of the molecular and cellular basis of lipid- associated disorders such as Tangier disease, Niemann - Pick disease type C and atherosclerosis. These insights have also led to improved understanding of normal physiology.
