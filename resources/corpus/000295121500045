Disentangling the Drivers of beta Diversity Along Latitudinal and Elevational Gradients
Understanding spatial variation in biodiversity along environmental gradients is a central theme in ecology. Differences in species compositional turnover among sites (beta diversity) occurring along gradients are often used to infer variation in the processes structuring communities. Here, we show that sampling alone predicts changes in beta diversity caused simply by changes in the sizes of species pools. For example, forest inventories sampled along latitudinal and elevational gradients show the well-documented pattern that beta diversity is higher in the tropics and at low elevations. However, after correcting for variation in pooled species richness (gamma diversity), these differences in beta diversity disappear. Therefore, there is no need to invoke differences in the mechanisms of community assembly in temperate versus tropical systems to explain these global-scale patterns of beta diversity.
