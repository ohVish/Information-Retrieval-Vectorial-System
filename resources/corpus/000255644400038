DNA from pre-Clovis human coprolites in Oregon, North America
The timing of the first human migration into the Americas and its relation to the appearance of the Clovis technological complex in North America at about 11,000 to 10,800 radiocarbon years before the present ( C-14 years B. P.) remains contentious. We establish that humans were present at Paisley 5 Mile Point Caves, in south- central Oregon, by 12,300 C-14 years B. P., through the recovery of human mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA) from coprolites, directly dated by accelerator mass spectrometry. The mtDNA corresponds to Native American founding haplogroups A2 and B2. The dates of the coprolites are > 1000 C-14 years earlier than currently accepted dates for the Clovis complex.
