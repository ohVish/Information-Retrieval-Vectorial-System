Toxin-induced conformational changes in a potassium channel revealed by solid-state NMR
The active site of potassium (K+) channels catalyses the transport of K+ ions across the plasma membrane(1)-similar to the catalytic function of the active site of an enzyme-and is inhibited by toxins from scorpion venom. On the basis of the conserved structures of K+ pore regions(2) and scorpion toxins(3,4), detailed structures for the K+ channel-scorpion toxin binding interface have been proposed. In these models and in previous solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies using detergent-solubilized membrane proteins(5,6), scorpion toxins were docked to the extracellular entrance of the K+ channel pore assuming rigid, preformed binding sites(7-13). Using high-resolution solid-state NMR spectroscopy, here we show that high-affinity binding of the scorpion toxin kaliotoxin to a chimaeric K+ channel (KcsA- Kv1.3)(14,15) is associated with significant structural rearrangements in both molecules. Our approach involves a combined analysis of chemical shifts and proton-proton distances and demonstrates that solid-state NMR is a sensitive method for analysing the structure of a membrane protein-inhibitor complex. We propose that structural flexibility of the K+ channel and the toxin represents an important determinant for the high specificity of toxin-K+ channel interactions.
