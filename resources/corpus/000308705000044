Structural Probing of a Protein Phosphatase 2A Network by Chemical Cross-Linking and Mass Spectrometry
The identification of proximate amino acids by chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry (XL-MS) facilitates the structural analysis of homogeneous protein complexes. We gained distance restraints on a modular interaction network of protein complexes affinity-purified from human cells by applying an adapted XL-MS protocol. Systematic analysis of human protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complexes identified 176 interprotein and 570 intraprotein cross-links that link specific trimeric PP2A complexes to a multitude of adaptor proteins that control their cellular functions. Spatial restraints guided molecular modeling of the binding interface between immunoglobulin binding protein 1 (IGBP1) and PP2A and revealed the topology of TCP1 ring complex (TRiC) chaperonin interacting with the PP2A regulatory subunit 2ABG. This study establishes XL-MS as an integral part of hybrid structural biology approaches for the analysis of endogenous protein complexes.
