Diurnal and Seasonal Mood Vary with Work, Sleep, and Daylength Across Diverse Cultures
We identified individual-level diurnal and seasonal mood rhythms in cultures across the globe, using data from millions of public Twitter messages. We found that individuals awaken in a good mood that deteriorates as the day progresses-which is consistent with the effects of sleep and circadian rhythm-and that seasonal change in baseline positive affect varies with change in daylength. People are happier on weekends, but the morning peak in positive affect is delayed by 2 hours, which suggests that people awaken later on weekends.
