Sleep, learning, and dreams: Off-line memory reprocessing
Converging evidence and new research methodologies from across the neurosciences permit the neuroscientific study of the role of steep in off-line memory reprocessing, as well as the nature and function of dreaming. Evidence supports a rote for sleep in the consolidation of an array of learning and memory tasks. In addition, new methodologies allow the experimental manipulation of dream content at steep onset, permitting an objective and scientific study of this dream formation and a renewed search for the possible functions of dreaming and the biological processes subserving it.
