An extreme distortion of the Van Allen belt arising from the 'Hallowe'en' solar storm in 2003
The Earth's radiation belts - also known as the Van Allen belts(1) contain high-energy electrons trapped on magnetic field lines(2,3). The centre of the outer belt is usually 20,000 - 25,000 km from Earth. The region between the belts is normally devoid of particles(2-4), and is accordingly favoured as a location for spacecraft operation because of the benign environment(5). Here we report that the outer Van Allen belt was compressed dramatically by a solar storm known as the 'Hallowe'en storm' of 2003. From 1 to 10 November, the outer belt had its centre only similar to10,000 km from Earth's equatorial surface, and the plasmasphere was similarly displaced inwards. The region between the belts became the location of high particle radiation intensity. This remarkable deformation of the entire magnetosphere implies surprisingly powerful acceleration and loss processes deep within the magnetosphere.
