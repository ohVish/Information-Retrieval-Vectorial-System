Early warming of tropical South America at the Last Glacial-interglacial transition
Glaciation in the humid tropical Andes is a sensitive indicator of mean annual temperature. Here, we present sedimentological data from takes beyond the glacial limit in the tropical Andes indicating that deglaciation from the Last Glacial Maximum led substantial warming at high northern latitudes. Deglaciation from glacial maximum positions at Lake Titicaca, Peru/Bolivia (16degreesS), and Lake Junin, Peru (11 degreesS), occurred 22,000 to 19,500 calendar years before the present, several thousand years before the Bolling-Allerod warming of the Northern Hemisphere and deglaciation of the Sierra Nevada, United States (36.5- to 38degreesN). The tropical Andes deglaciated while climatic conditions remained regionally wet, which reflects the dominant control of mean annual temperature on tropical glaciation.
