Scale invariance and universality of force networks in static granular matter
Force networks form the skeleton of static granular matter(1,2). They are the key factor that determines mechanical properties such as stability(3), elasticity(4,5) and sound transmission(6,7), which are important for civil engineering and industrial processing. Previous studies have focused on investigations of the global structure of external forces(8-11) ( the boundary condition) and on the probability distribution of individual contact forces(4,12). So far, however, precise knowledge of the disordered spatial structure of the force network has remained elusive. Here we report that molecular dynamics simulations of realistic granular packings reveal scale invariance of clusters of particles interacting by means of relatively strong forces. Despite visual variation, force networks for various values of the confining pressure and other parameters have identical scaling exponents and scaling function, thereby determining a universality class. Unexpectedly, the flat ensemble of force configurations(13-15) (a simple generalization of equilibrium statistical mechanics) belongs to this universality class, whereas some widely studied simplified models(16-18) do not. This implies that the elasticity of the grains and their geometrical disorder do not affect the universal mechanical properties.
