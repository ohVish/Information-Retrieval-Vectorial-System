Chirality in Planar Cell Shape Contributes to Left-Right Asymmetric Epithelial Morphogenesis
Some organs in animals display left-right (LR) asymmetry. To better understand LR asymmetric morphogenesis in Drosophila, we studied LR directional rotation of the hindgut epithelial tube. Hindgut epithelial cells adopt a LR asymmetric (chiral) cell shape within their plane, and we refer to this cell behavior as planar cell-shape chirality (PCC). Drosophila E-cadherin (DE-Cad) is distributed to cell boundaries with LR asymmetry, which is responsible for the PCC formation. Myosin ID switches the LR polarity found in PCC and in DE-Cad distribution, which coincides with the direction of rotation. An in silico simulation showed that PCC is sufficient to induce the directional rotation of this tissue. Thus, the intrinsic chirality of epithelial cells in vivo is an underlying mechanism for LR asymmetric tissue morphogenesis.
