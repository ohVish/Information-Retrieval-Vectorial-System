Minimal machinery of RNA polymerase holoenzyme sufficient for promoter melting
We determined the minimal portion of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase ( RNAP) holoenzyme able to accomplish promoter melting, the crucial step in transcription initiation that provides RNAP access to the template strand. Upon duplex DNA binding, the N terminus of the beta' subunit ( amino acids 1 to 314) and amino acids 94 to 507 of the sigma subunit, together comprising less than one-fifth of RNAP holoenzyme, were able to melt an extended - 10 promoter in a reaction remarkably similar to that of authentic holoenzyme. Our results support the model that capture of nontemplate bases extruded from the DNA helix underlies the melting process.
