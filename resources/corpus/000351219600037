Experimental ground-state combination differences of CH5+
Protonation of methane (CH4), a rather rigid molecule well described by quantum mechanics, produces CH5+, a prototypical floppy molecule that has eluded definitive spectroscopic description. Experimental measurement of high-resolution spectra of pure CH5+ samples poses a formidable challenge. By applying two types of action spectroscopy predicated on photoinduced reaction with CO2 and photoinhibition of helium cluster growth, we obtained low-temperature, high-resolution spectra of mass-selected CH5+. On the basis of the very high accuracy of the line positions, we determined a spectrum of combination differences. Analysis of this spectrum enabled derivation of equally accurate ground state-level schemes of the corresponding nuclear spin isomers of CH5+, as well as tentative quantum number assignment of this enfant terrible of molecular spectroscopy.
