Mg/Al ordering in layered double hydroxides revealed by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy
The anion- exchange ability of layered double hydroxides ( LDHs) has been exploited to create materials for use in catalysis, drug delivery, and environmental remediation. The specific cation arrangements in the hydroxide layers of hydrotalcite- like LDHs, of general formula Mg(1-x)(2+)Al(x)(3+)OH(2)(Anion(x/n)(n-)).yH(2)O, have, however, remained elusive, and their elucidation could enhance the functional optimization of these materials. We applied rapid ( 60 kilohertz) magic angle spinning ( MAS) to obtain high- resolution hydrogen- 1 nuclear magnetic resonance ( (1)H NMR) spectra and characterize the magnesium and aluminum distribution. These data, in combination with (1)H-(27)Al double- resonance and (25)Mg triple- quantum MAS NMR data, show that the cations are fully ordered for magnesium: aluminum ratios of 2:1 and that at lower aluminum content, a nonrandom distribution of cations persists, with no Al(3+)-Al(3+) close contacts. The application of rapid MAS NMR methods to investigate proton distributions in a wide range of materials is readily envisaged.
