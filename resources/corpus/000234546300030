Quantum dynamics of a d-wave Josephson junction
Here we present the direct observation of macroscopic quantum properties in an all high-critical-temperature superconductor d-wave Josephson junction. Although dissipation caused by low-energy excitations is expected to strongly suppress macroscopic quantum effects, we demonstrate energy level quantization in our d-wave Josephson junction. The result indicates that the role of dissipation mechanisms in high-temperature superconductors has to be revised, and it may also have consequences for the class of solid-state "quiet" quantum bits with superior coherence time.
