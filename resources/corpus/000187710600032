Supramolecular self-assembly of macroscopic tubes
The macroscopic molecular self-assembly of an amphiphilic hyperbranched copolymer in acetone generated multiwalled tubes millimeters in diameter and centimeters in length. The thickness of the tube walls approaches 400 nanometers, and the walls have an inhomogeneous lamella structure that alternates between ordered hydrophilic domains and amorphous, partly irregular hydrophilic domains.
