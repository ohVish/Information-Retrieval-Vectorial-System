Packing C-60 in boron nitride nanotubes
We have created insulated C-60 nanowire by packing C-60 molecules into the interior of insulating boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs). For small-diameter BNNTs, the wire consists of a linear chain of C-60 molecules. With increasing BNNT inner diameter, unusual C-60 stacking configurations are obtained (including helical, hollow core, and incommensurate) that are unknown for bulk or thin-film forms of C-60. C-60 in BNNTs thus presents a model system for studying the properties of dimensionally constrained "silo" crystal structures. For the linear-chain case, we have fused the C-60 molecules to form a single-walled carbon nanotube inside the insulating BNNT.
