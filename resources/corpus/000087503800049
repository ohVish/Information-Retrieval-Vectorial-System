Atomic structure of PDE4: Insights into phosphodiesterase mechanism and specificity
Cyclic nucleotides are second messengers that are essential in vision, muscle contraction, neurotransmission, exocytosis, cell growth, and differentiation. These molecules are degraded by a family of enzymes known as phosphodiesterases, which serve a critical function by regulating the intracellular concentration of cyclic nucleotides. We have determined the three-dimensional structure of the catalytic domain of phosphodiesterase 4B2B to 1.77 angstrom resolution. The active site has been identified and contains a cluster of two metal atoms. The structure suggests the mechanism of action and basis for specificity and will provide a framework for structure-assisted drug design for members of the phosphodiesterase family.
