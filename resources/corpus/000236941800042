Ultrafast laser-driven microlens to focus and energy-select mega-electron volt protons
We present a technique for simultaneous focusing and energy selection of high-current, mega-electron volt proton beams With the use of radial, transient electric fields (107 to 1010 volts per meter) triggered on the inner walls of a hollow microcylinder by an intense subpicosecond laser pulse. Because of the transient nature of the focusing fields, the proposed method allows selection of a desired range out of the spectrum of the polyenergetic proton beam. This technique addresses current drawbacks of laser-accelerated proton beams, such as their broad spectrum and divergence at the source.
