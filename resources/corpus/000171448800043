Ferromagnetic imprinting of nuclear spins in semiconductors
We examine how a ferromagnetic layer affects the coherent electron spin dynamics in a neighboring gallium arsenide semiconductor. Uttrafast optical pump-probe measurements reveal that the spin dynamics are unexpectedly dominated by hyperpolarized nuclear spins that align along the ferromagnet's magnetization. We find evidence that photoexcited carriers acquire spin-polarization from the ferromagnet, and dynamically polarize these nuclear spins. The resulting hyperfine fields are as high as 9000 gauss in small external fields (less than 1000 gauss), enabling ferromagnetic control of local electron spin coherence.
