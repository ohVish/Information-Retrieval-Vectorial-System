Orchestrating size and shape during morphogenesis
Living organisms exhibit tremendous diversity, evident in the large repertoire of forms and considerable size range. Scientists have discovered that conserved mechanisms control the development of all organisms. Drosophila has proved to be a particularly powerful model system with which to identify the signalling pathways that organize tissue patterns. More recently, much has been learned about the control of tissue growth, tissue shape and their coordination at the cellular and tissue levels. New models integrate how specific signals and mechanical forces shape tissues and may also control their size.
