Distinct ensemble codes in hippocampal areas CA3 and CA1
The hippocampus has differentiated into an extensively connected recurrent stage (CA3) followed by a feed-forward stage (CA1). We examined the function of this structural differentiation by determining how cell ensembles in rat CA3 and CA1 generate representations of rooms with common spatial elements. In CA3, distinct subsets of pyramidal cells were activated in each room, regardless of the similarity of the testing enclosure. In CA1, the activated populations overlapped, and the overlap increased in similar enclosures. After exposure to a novel room, ensemble activity developed slower in CA3 than CA1, suggesting that the representations emerged independently.
