Modular Organic Structure-Directing Agents for the Synthesis of Zeolites
Organic structure-directing agents (OSDAs) are used to guide the formation of particular types of pores and channels during the synthesis of zeolites. We report that the use of highly versatile OSDAs based on phosphazenes has been successfully introduced for the synthesis of zeolites. This approach has made possible the synthesis of the elusive boggsite zeolite, which is formed by 10- and 12-ring intersecting channels. This topology and these pore dimensions present interesting opportunities for catalysis in reactions of industrial relevance.
