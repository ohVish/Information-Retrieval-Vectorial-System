Regenerating the damaged central nervous system
It is self-evident that the adult mammalian brain and spinal cord do not regenerate after injury, but recent discoveries have forced a reconsideration of this accepted principle. Advances in our understanding of how the brain develops have provided a rough blueprint for how we may bring about regeneration in the damaged brain. Studies in developmental neurobiology, intracellular signalling and neuroimmunology are bringing the regeneration field closer to success. Notwithstanding these advances, clear and indisputable evidence for adult functional regeneration remains to be shown.
