High-performance transition metal-doped Pt3Ni octahedra for oxygen reduction reaction
Bimetallic platinum-nickel (Pt-Ni) nanostructures represent an emerging class of electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells, but practical applications have been limited by catalytic activity and durability. We surface-doped Pt3Ni octahedra supported on carbon with transition metals, termed M-Pt3Ni/C, where M is vanadium, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, molybdenum (Mo), tungsten, or rhenium. The Mo-Pt3Ni/C showed the best ORR performance, with a specific activity of 10.3 mA/cm(2) and mass activity of 6.98 A/mg(Pt), which are 81- and 73-fold enhancements compared with the commercial Pt/C catalyst (0.127 mA/cm(2) and 0.096 A/mg(Pt)). Theoretical calculations suggest that Mo prefers subsurface positions near the particle edges in vacuum and surface vertex/edge sites in oxidizing conditions, where it enhances both the performance and the stability of the Pt3Ni catalyst.
