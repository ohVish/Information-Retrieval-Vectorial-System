Io's thermal emission from the Galileo photopolarimeter-radiometer
Galileo's photopolarimeter-radiometer instrument mapped to's thermal emission during the 124, 125, and 127 flybys with a spatial resolution of 2.2 to 300 kilometers. Mapping of Loki in 124 shows uniform temperatures for most of Loki Patera and high temperatures in the southwest corner, probably resulting from an eruption that began 1 month before the observation. Most of Loki Patera was resurfaced before 127. Pele's caldera floor has a low temperature of 160 kelvin, whereas flows at Pillan and Zamama have temperatures of up to 200 kelvin, Global maps of nighttime temperatures provide a means for estimating global heat flow.
