PPAR-alpha and glucocorticoid receptor synergize to promote erythroid progenitor self-renewal
Many acute and chronic anaemias, including haemolysis, sepsis and genetic bone marrow failure diseases such as Diamond-Blackfan anaemia, are not treatable with erythropoietin (Epo), because the colony-forming unit erythroid progenitors (CFU-Es) that respond to Epo are either too few in number or are not sensitive enough to Epo to maintain sufficient red blood cell production(1-9). Treatment of these anaemias requires a drug that acts at an earlier stage of red cell formation and enhances the formation of Epo-sensitive CFU-E progenitors. Recently, we showed that glucocorticoids specifically stimulate self-renewal of an early erythroid progenitor, burst-forming unit erythroid (BFU-E), and increase the production of terminally differentiated erythroid cells(10,11). Here we show that activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-alpha) by the PPAR-alpha agonists GW7647 and fenofibrate synergizes with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) to promote BFU-E self-renewal. Over time these agonists greatly increase production of mature red blood cells in cultures of both mouse fetal liver BFU-Es and mobilized human adult CD34(+) peripheral blood progenitors, with a new and effective culture system being used for the human cells that generates normal enucleated reticulocytes. Although Ppara(-/-) mice show no haematological difference from wild-typemice in both normal and phenylhydrazine (PHZ)-induced stress erythropoiesis, PPAR-alpha agonists facilitate recovery of wild-type but not Ppara(-/-) mice from PHZ-induced acute haemolytic anaemia. We also show that PPAR-alpha alleviates anaemia in a mouse model of chronic anaemia. Finally, both in control and corticosteroid- treated BFU-E cells, PPAR-alpha co-occupies many chromatin sites with GR; when activated by PPAR-alpha agonists, additional PPAR-alpha is recruited to GR-adjacent sites and presumably facilitates GR-dependent BFU-E self-renewal. Our discovery of the role of PPAR-alpha agonists in stimulating self-renewal of early erythroid progenitor cells suggests that the clinically tested PPAR-alpha agonists we used may improve the efficacy of corticosteroids in treating Epo-resistant anaemias.
