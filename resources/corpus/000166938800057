Computational comparison of two draft sequences of the human genome
We are in the enviable position of having two distinct drafts of the human genome sequence. Although gaps, errors, redundancy and incomplete annotation mean that individually each falls short of the ideal, many of these problems can be assessed by comparison. Here we present some comparative analyses of these drafts. We look at a number of features of the sequences, including sequence gaps, continuity, consistency between the two sequences and patterns of DNA-binding protein motifs.
