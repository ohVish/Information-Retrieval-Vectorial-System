Massive expansion of marine archaea during a mid-Cretaceous oceanic anoxic event
Biogeochemical and stable carbon isotopic analysis of black-share sequences deposited during an Albian oceanic anoxic event (similar to 112 million years ago) indicate that up to 80 weight percent of sedimentary organic carbon is derived from marine, nonthermophilic archaea, The carbon-13 content of archaeal molecular fossils indicates that these archaea were Living chemoautotrophically. Their massive expansion may have been a response to the strong stratification of the ocean during this anoxic event. Indeed, the sedimentary record of archaeal membrane lipids suggests that this anoxic event marks a time in Earth history at which certain hyperthermophilic archaea adapted to low-temperature environments.
