Cdc6 synthesis regulates replication competence in Xenopus oocytes
The early division cycles of an embryo rely on the oocyte's ability to replicate DNA. During meiosis, oocytes temporarily lose this ability. After a single round of pre-meiotic S-phase, oocytes enter meiosis and rapidly arrest at prophase of meiosis I (G2)(1). Upon hormonal stimulation, arrested oocytes resume meiosis, reestablish DNA replication competence in meiosis I shortly after germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD), but repress replication until fertilization(2,3). How oocytes lose and regain replication competence during meiosis are important questions underlying the production of functional gametes. Here we show that the inability of immature Xenopus oocytes to replicate is linked to the absence of the Cdc6 protein and the cytoplasmic localization of other initiation proteins. Injection of Cdc6 protein into immature oocytes does not induce DNA replication. However, injection of Cdc6 into oocytes undergoing GVBD is sufficient to induce DNA replication in the absence of protein synthesis. Our results show that GVBD and Cdc6 synthesis are the only events that limit the establishment of the oocyte's replication competence during meiosis.
