Allosteric mechanisms of signal transduction
Forty years ago, a simple model of allosteric mechanisms (indirect interactions between distinct sites), used initially to explain feedback-inhibited enzymes, was presented by Monod, Wyman, and Changeux. We review the MWC theory and its applications for the understanding of signal transduction in biology, and also identify remaining issues that deserve theoretical and experimental substantiation.
