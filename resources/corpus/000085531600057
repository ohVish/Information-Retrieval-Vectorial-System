Mirror-image confusion in single neurons of the macaque inferotemporal cortex
Humans and animals confuse Lateral mirror images, such as the Letters "b" and "d," more often than vertical mirror images, such as the Letters "b" and "p," Experiments were performed to find a neural correlate of this phenomenon. Visually responsive pattern-selective neurons in the inferotemporal cortex of macaque monkeys responded more similarly to members of a Lateral mirror-image pair than to members of a vertical mirror-image pair. The phenomenon developed within 20 milliseconds of the onset of the visual response and persisted to its end. It occurred during presentation of stimuli both at the fovea and in the periphery.
