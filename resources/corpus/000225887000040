Dating the Late Archaic occupation of the Norte Chico region in Peru
The Norte Chico region on the coast of Peru north of Lima consists of four adjacent river valleys - Huaura, Supe, Pativilca and Fortaleza - in which archaeologists have been aware of a number work in 2002 and 2003 to determine the dates of occupation of sites in the Fortaleza and Pativilca valleys. Here we present 95 new radiocarbon dates from a sample of 13 of more than 20 large, early sites. These sites share certain basic characteristics, including large-scale monumental architecture, extensive residential architecture and a lack of ceramics. The 95 new dates confirm the emergence and development of a major cultural complex in this region during the Late Archaic period between 3000 and 1800 calibrated calendar years BC. The results help to redefine a broader understanding of the respective roles of agricultural and fishing economies in the beginnings of civilization in South America.
