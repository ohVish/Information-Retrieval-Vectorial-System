Simultaneous fluorescence and Raman scattering from single carbon nanotubes
Single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy was used to determine the electronic properties of individual single-walled carbon nanotubes. Carbon nanotube structure was determined simultaneously from Raman spectroscopy. Fluorescence spectra from individual nanotubes with identical structures have different emission energies and linewidths that likely arise from defects or the local environment. Unlike most other molecules studied to date, the fluorescence intensity or spectrum from a single nanotube unexpectedly did not fluctuate.
