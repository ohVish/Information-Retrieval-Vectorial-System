Dendritic cell-induced memory T cell activation in nonlymphoid tissues
Secondary lymphoid organs are dominant sites of T cell activation, although many T cells are subsequently retained within peripheral tissues. Currently, these nonlymphoid compartments are viewed as sites only of effector T cell function, without the involvement of renewed induction of immunity via the interactions with professional antigen- presenting cells. We describe a method of reactivation of herpes simplex virus to examine the stimulation of tissue- resident T cells during secondary challenge. The results revealed that memory CD8(+) T cell responses can be initiated within peripheral tissues through a tripartite interaction that includes CD4(+) T cells and recruited dendritic cells. These findings lend evidence for the existence of a sophisticated T cell response mechanism in extra- lymphoid tissues that can act to control localized infection.
