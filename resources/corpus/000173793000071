Production of alpha-1,3-galactosyltransferase knockout pigs by nuclear transfer coning
The presence of galactose alpha-1,3-galactose residues on the surface of pig cells is a major obstacle to successful xenotransplantation. Here, we report the production of four live pigs in which one allele of the alpha-1,3-galactosyltransferase locus has been knocked out. These pigs were produced by nuclear transfer technology; clonal fetal fibroblast cell lines were used as nuclear donors for embryos reconstructed with enucleated pig oocytes.
