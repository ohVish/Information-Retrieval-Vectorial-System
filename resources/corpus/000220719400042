Direct spinning of carbon nanotube fibers from chemical vapor deposition synthesis
Many routes have been developed for the synthesis of carbon nanotubes, but their assembly into continuous fibers has been achieved only through post-processing methods. We spun fibers and ribbons of carbon nanotubes directly from the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) synthesis zone of a furnace using a liquid source of carbon and an iron nanocatalyst. This process was realized through the appropriate choice of reactants, control of the reaction conditions, and continuous withdrawal of the product with a rotating spindle used in various geometries. This direct spinning from a CVD reaction zone is extendable to other types of fiber and to the spin coating of rotating objects in general.
