Wolbachia establishment and invasion in an Aedes aegypti laboratory population
A proposed strategy to aid in controlling the growing burden of vector-borne disease is population replacement, in which a natural vector population is replaced by a population with a reduced capacity for disease transmission. An important component of such a strategy is the drive system; which serves to spread a desired genotype into the targeted field population. Endosymbiotic Wolbachia. bacteria are potential transgene drivers, but infections do not naturally occur in some important mosquito vectors, notably Aedes aegypti. In this work, stable infections of wAlbB Wolbachia were established in A. aegypti and caused high rates of cytoplasmic incompatibility (that is, elimination of egg hatch). Laboratory cage tests demonstrated the ability of wAlbB to spread into an A. aegypti population after seeding of an uninfected population with infected females, reaching infection fixation within seven generations.
