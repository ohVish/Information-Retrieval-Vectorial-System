Subducted seamount imaged in the rupture zone of the 1946 Nankaido earthquake
The Nankai Trough is a vigorous subduction zone where large earthquakes have been recorded since the seventh century, with a recurrence time of 100 to 200 years. The 1946 Nankaido earthquake was unusual, with a rupture zone estimated from long-period geodetic data that was more than twice as Large as that derived from shorter period seismic data. In the center of this earthquake rupture zone, we used densely deployed ocean bottom seismographs to detect a subducted seamount 13 kilometers thick by 50 kilometers wide at a depth of 10 kilometers. We propose that this seamount might work as a barrier inhibiting brittle seismogenic rupture.
