Locally dynamic synaptic learning rules in pyramidal neuron dendrites
Long- term potentiation ( LTP) of synaptic transmission underlies aspects of learning and memory. LTP is input- specific at the level of individual synapses, but neural network models predict interactions between plasticity at nearby synapses. Here we show in mouse hippocampal pyramidal cells that LTP at individual synapses reduces the threshold for potentiation at neighbouring synapses. After input- specific LTP induction by two- photon glutamate uncaging or by synaptic stimulation, subthreshold stimuli, which by themselves were too weak to trigger LTP, caused robust LTP and spine enlargement at neighbouring spines. Furthermore, LTP induction broadened the presynaptic - postsynaptic spike interval for spike- timing- dependent LTP within a dendritic neighbourhood. The reduction in the threshold for LTP induction lasted similar to 10 min and spread over similar to 10 mm of dendrite. These local interactions between neighbouring synapses support clustered plasticity models of memory storage and could allow for the binding of behaviourally linked information on the same dendritic branch.
