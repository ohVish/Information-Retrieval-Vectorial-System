On-wire lithography
We report a high-throughput procedure for lithographically processing one-dimensional nanowires. This procedure, termed on-wire lithography, combines advances in temptate-directed synthesis of nanowires with electrochemical deposition and wet-chemical etching and allows routine fabrication of face-to-face disk arrays and gap structures in the range of five to several hundred nanometers. We studied the transport properties of 13-nanometer gaps with and without nanoscopic amounts of conducting polymers deposited within by dip-pen nanotithography.
