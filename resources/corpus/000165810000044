Glucose-dependent insulin release from genetically engineered K cells
Genetic engineering of non-beta cells to release insulin upon feeding could be a therapeutic modality for patients with diabetes. A tumor-derived K-cell line was induced to produce human insulin by providing the cells with the human insulin gene linked tb the 5'-regulatory region of the gene encoding glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). Mice expressing this transgene produced human insulin specifically in gut K cells. This insulin protected the mice from developing diabetes and maintained glucose tolerance after destruction of the native insulin-producing beta cells.
