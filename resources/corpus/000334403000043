Brainstem nucleus MdV mediates skilled forelimb motor tasks


Translating the behavioural output of the nervous system into movement involves interaction between brain and spinal
cord. The brainstem provides an essential bridge between the two structures
but circuit-level organization and function
of this intermediary system remain poorly understood. Here we use intersectional virus tracing and genetic strategies in
mice to reveal a selective synaptic connectivity matrix between brainstem substructures and functionally distinct spinal
motor neurons that regulate limb movement. The brainstem nucleus medullary reticular formation ventral part (MdV)
stands out as specifically targeting subpopulations of forelimb-innervating motor neurons. Its glutamatergic premotor
neurons receive synaptic input from key upper motor centres and are recruited during motor tasks. Selective neuronal
ablation or silencing experiments reveal that MdV is critically important specifically for skilled motor behaviour
including
accelerating rotarod and single-food-pellet reaching tasks. Our results indicate that distinct premotor brainstem
