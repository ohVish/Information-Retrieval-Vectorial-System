A dinuclear Ni(mu-H)Ru complex derived from H-2
Models of the active site in [NiFe] hydrogenase enzymes have proven challenging to prepare. We isolated a paramagnetic dinuclear nickel-ruthenium complex with a bridging hydrido ligand from the heterolytic cleavage of H-2 by a dinuclear NiRu aqua complex in water under ambient conditions (20 degrees C and 1 atmosphere pressure). The structure of the hexacoordinate Ni(mu-H) Ru complex was unequivocally determined by neutron diffraction analysis, and it comes closest to an effective analog for the core structure of the proposed active form of the enzyme.
