Control of excitatory and inhibitory synapse formation by neuroligins
The normal function of neural networks depends on a delicate balance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. Synapse formation is thought to be regulated by bidirectional signaling between pre- and postsynaptic cells. We demonstrate that members of the Neuroligin family promote postsynaptic differentiation in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Down-regulation of neuroligin isoform expression by RNA interference results in a loss of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Etectrophysiological analysis revealed a predominant reduction of inhibitory synaptic function. Thus, neuroligins control the formation and functional balance of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in hippocampal neurons.
