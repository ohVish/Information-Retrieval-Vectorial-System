Lack of replicative senescence in normal rodent glia
Replicative senescence is thought to be an intrinsic mechanism for Limiting the proliferative Life-span of normal somatic cells. We show here that rat Schwann cells can be expanded indefinitely in culture while maintaining checkpoints normally Lost during the immortalization process. These findings demonstrate that senescence is not an inevitable consequence of extended proliferation in culture.
