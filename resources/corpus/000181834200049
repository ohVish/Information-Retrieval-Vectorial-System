The infrared spectrum of Al2H6 in solid hydrogen
Although many volatile binary boron hydride compounds are known, binary aluminum hydride chemistry is limited to the polymeric (AlH3)(n) solid. The reaction of laser-ablated aluminum atoms and pure H-2 during codeposition at 3.5 kelvin, followed by ultraviolet irradiation and annealing to 6.5 kelvin, allows dinnerization of the intermediate AlH3 photolysis product to form Al2H6. The Al2H6 molecule is identified by seven new infrared absorptions that are accurately predicted by quantum chemical calculations for dibridged Al2H6, a molecule that is isostructural with diborane.
