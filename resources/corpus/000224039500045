Zooming in on a quantitative trait for tomato yield using interspecific introgressions
To explore natural biodiversity we developed and examined introgression lines (ILs) containing chromosome segments of wild species (Solanum pennellii) in the background of the cultivated tomato (S. lycopersicum). We identified Brix9-2-5, which is a S. pennellii quantitative trait locus (QTL) that increases sugar yield of tomatoes and was mapped within a flower- and fruit-specific invertase (LIN5). QTL analysis representing five different tomato species delimited the functional polymorphism of Brix-9-2-5 to an amino acid near the catalytic site of the invertase crystal, affecting enzyme kinetics and fruit sink strength. These results underline the power of diverse ILs for high-resolution perspectives on complex phenotypes.
