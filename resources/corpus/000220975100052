Regeneration of peroxiredoxins by p53-regulated sestrins, homologs of bacterial AhpD
Acting as a signal, hydrogen peroxide circumvents antioxidant defense by over-oxidizing peroxiredoxins (Prxs), the enzymes that metabolize peroxides. We show that sestrins, a family of proteins whose expression is modulated by p53, are required for regeneration of Prxs containing Cys-SO2H, thus reestablishing the antioxidant firewall. Sestrins contain a predicted redox-active domain homologous to AhpD, the enzyme catalyzing the reduction of a bacterial Prx, AhpC. Purified Hi95 (sestrin 2) protein supports adenosine triphosphate-dependent reduction of over-oxidized Prxl in vitro, indicating that unlike AhpD, which is a disulfide reductase, sestrins are cysteine sulfinyl reductases. As modulators of peroxide signaling and antioxidant defense, sestrins constitute potential therapeutic targets.
