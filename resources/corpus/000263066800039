Confined Crystallization of Polyethylene Oxide in Nanolayer Assemblies
The design and fabrication of ultrathin polymer layers are of increasing importance because of the rapid development of nanoscience and nanotechnology. Confined, two- dimensional crystallization of polymers presents challenges and opportunities due to the long- chain, covalently bonded nature of the macromolecule. Using an innovative layer- multiplying coextrusion process to obtain assemblies with thousands of polymer nanolayers, we discovered a morphology that emerges as confined polyethylene oxide ( PEO) layers are made progressively thinner. When the thickness is confined to 20 nanometers, the PEO crystallizes as single, high- aspect- ratio lamellae that resemble single crystals. Unexpectedly, the crystallization habit imparts two orders of magnitude reduction in the gas permeability.
