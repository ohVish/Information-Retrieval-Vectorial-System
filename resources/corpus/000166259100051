Guidance of cell migration by EGF receptor signaling during Drosophila oogenesis
Directed cell migration is important for many aspects of normal animal development, but Little is known about how cell migrations are guided or the mechanisms by which guidance cues are translated into directed cell movement. Here we present evidence that signaling mediated by the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) guides dorsal migration of border cells during Drosophila oogenesis. The transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha)-like ligand Gurken appears to serve as the guidance cue. To mediate this guidance function, EGFR signals via a pathway that is independent of Raf-MAP kinase and receptor-specific.
