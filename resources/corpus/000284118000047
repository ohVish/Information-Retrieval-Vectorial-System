Peripherally Applied A beta-Containing Inoculates Induce Cerebral beta-Amyloidosis
The intracerebral injection of beta-amyloid-containing brain extracts can induce cerebral beta-amyloidosis and associated pathologies in susceptible hosts. We found that intraperitoneal inoculation with beta-amyloid-rich extracts induced beta-amyloidosis in the brains of beta-amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice after prolonged incubation times.
