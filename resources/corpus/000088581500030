Ferromagnetism stabilized by lattice distortion at the surface of the p-wave superconductor Sr2RuO4
Ferromagnetic (FM) spin fluctuations are believed to mediate the spin-triplet pairing for the rho-wave superconductivity in Sr2RuO4. Our experiments show that, at the surface, a bulk soft-phonon mode freezes into a static Lattice distortion associated with an in-plane rotation of the RuO6 octahedron. First-principle calculations confirm this structure and predict a FM ground state at the surface. This coupling between structure and magnetism in the environment of broken symmetry at the surface allows a reconsideration of the coupling mechanism in the bulk.
