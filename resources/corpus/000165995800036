A quantum dot single-photon turnstile device
Quantum communication relies on the availability of Light pulses with strong quantum correlations among photons. An example of such an optical source is a single-photon pulse with a vanishing probability for detecting two or more photons. Using pulsed laser excitation of a single quantum dot, a single-photon turnstile device that generates a train of single-photon pulses was demonstrated. For a spectrally isolated quantum dot, nearly 100% of the excitation pulses Lead to emission of a single photon, yielding an ideal single-photon source.
