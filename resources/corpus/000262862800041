Serotonin Mediates Behavioral Gregarization Underlying Swarm Formation in Desert Locusts
Desert locusts, Schistocerca gregaria, show extreme phenotypic plasticity, transforming between a little- seen solitarious phase and the notorious swarming gregarious phase depending on population density. An essential tipping point in the process of swarm formation is the initial switch from strong mutual aversion in solitarious locusts to coherent group formation and greater activity in gregarious locusts. We show here that serotonin, an evolutionarily conserved mediator of neuronal plasticity, is responsible for this behavioral transformation, being both necessary if behavioral gregarization is to occur and sufficient to induce it. Our data demonstrate a neurochemical mechanism linking interactions between individuals to large- scale changes in population structure and the onset of mass migration.
