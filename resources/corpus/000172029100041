Sharper images by focusing soft X-rays with photon sieves
Fresnel zone plates consisting of alternating transmissive and opaque circular rings can be used to focus X-rays(1). The spatial resolution that can be achieved with these devices is of the order of the width of the outermost zone and is therefore limited by the smallest structure (20-40 nm) that can be fabricated by lithography today(2). Here we show that a large number of pinholes distributed appropriately over the Fresnel zones make it possible to focus soft X-rays to spot sizes smaller than the diameter of the smallest pinhole. In addition, higher orders of diffraction and secondary maxima can be suppressed by several orders of magnitude. In combination with the next generation of synchrotron light sources (free-electron lasers) these 'photon sieves' offer new opportunities for high-resolution X-ray microscopy and spectroscopy in physical and life sciences.
