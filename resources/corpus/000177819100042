Internal olefins to linear amines
The selective synthesis of linear amines from internal olefins or olefin mixtures was achieved through a catalytic one-pot reaction consisting of an initial olefin isomerization followed by hydroformylation and reductive amination. Key to the success is the use of specially designed phosphine ligands in the presence of rhodium catalysts. This reaction constitutes an economically attractive and environmentally favorable synthesis of linear aliphatic amines.
