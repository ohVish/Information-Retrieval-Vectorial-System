Stabilizing Rabi oscillations in a superconducting qubit using quantum feedback
The act of measurement bridges the quantum and classical worlds by projecting a superposition of possible states into a single (probabilistic) outcome. The timescale of this 'instantaneous' process can be stretched using weak measurements(1,2), such that it takes the form of a gradual random walk towards a final state. Remarkably, the interim measurement record is sufficient to continuously track and steer the quantum state using feedback(3-8). Here we implement quantum feedback control in a solid-state system, namely a superconducting quantum bit (qubit) coupled to a microwave cavity(9). A weak measurement of the qubit is implemented by probing the cavity with microwave photons, maintaining its average occupation at less than one photon. These photons are then directed to a high-bandwidth, quantum-noise-limited amplifier(10,11), which allows real-time monitoring of the state of the cavity (and, hence, that of the qubit) with high fidelity. We demonstrate quantum feedback control by inhibiting the decay of Rabi oscillations, allowing them to persist indefinitely(12). Such an ability permits the active suppression of decoherence and enables a method of quantum error correction based on weak continuous measurements(13,14). Other applications include quantum state stabilization(4,7,15), entanglement generation using measurement(16), state purification(17) and adaptive measurements(18,19).
