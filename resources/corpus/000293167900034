Second messenger role for Mg2+ revealed by human T-cell immunodeficiency
The magnesium ion, Mg2+, is essential for all life as a cofactor for ATP, polyphosphates such as DNA and RNA, and metabolic enzymes, but whether it plays a part in intracellular signalling (as Ca2+ does) is unknown. Here we identify mutations in the magnesium transporter gene, MAGT1, in a novel X-linked human immunodeficiency characterized by CD4 lymphopenia, severe chronic viral infections, and defective T-lymphocyte activation. We demonstrate that a rapid transient Mg2+ influx is induced by antigen receptor stimulation in normal T cells and by growth factor stimulation in non-lymphoid cells. MAGT1 deficiency abrogates the Mg2+ influx, leading to impaired responses to antigen receptor engagement, including defective activation of phospholipase C gamma 1 and a markedly impaired Ca2+ influx in T cells but not B cells. These observations reveal a role for Mg2+ as an intracellular second messenger coupling cell-surface receptor activation to intracellular effectors and identify MAGT1 as a possible target for novel therapeutics.
