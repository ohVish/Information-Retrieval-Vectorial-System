Taming superacids: Stabilization of the fullerene cations HC60+ and C-60(.+)
A new superacid, H(CB11H6X6) (where X = chlorine or bromine), whose conjugate base is the exceptionally inert CB11H6X6- carborane anion, separates Bronsted acidity from oxidizing capacity and anion nucleophilicity in a manner not previously achieved. Reaction of this superacid with C-60 gives HC60+ as a stable ion in solution and in the solid state. In a separate experiment, an oxidant was developed such that the long-sought C-60(.+) ion can be synthesized in solution. The preparation of these two fullerene carbocations is a notable departure from the prevalent chemistry of C-60, which is dominated by the formation of anions or the addition of nucleophiles. The H(CB11H6X6) superacid overcomes the major limitations of presently known superacids and has potentially wide application.
