Prostaglandin E-2 promotes colon cancer cell growth through a G(s)-axin-beta-catenin signaling axis
How cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and its proinflammatory metabolite prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) enhance colon cancer progression remains poorly understood. We show that PGE2 stimulates colon cancer cell growth through its heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptor, EP2, by a signaling route that involves the activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase and the protein kinase Akt by free G protein beta gamma subunits and the direct association of the G protein a. subunit with the regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) domain of axin. This leads to the inactivation and release of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta from its complex with axin, thereby relieving the inhibitory phosphorytation of beta-catenin and activating its signaling pathway. These findings may provide a molecular framework for the future evaluation of chemopreventive strategies for colorectal cancer.
