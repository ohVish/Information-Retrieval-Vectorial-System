Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock
We show that, in the mouse, the core mechanism for the master circadian clock consists of interacting positive and negative transcription and translation feedback Loops. Analysis of Clock/Clock mutant mice, homozygous period2(Brdm1) mutants, and Cryptochrome-deficient mice reveals substantially altered Small rhythms, consistent with a dominant role of PERIOD2 in the positive regulation of the Bmal1 Loop. In vitro analysis of CRYPTOCHROME inhibition of CLOCK: BMAL1-mediated transcription shows that the inhibition is through direct protein:protein interactions, independent of the PERIOD and TIMELESS proteins. PERIOD2 is a positive regulator of the Bmal1 Loop, and CRYPTOCHROMES are the negative regulators of the Period and Cryptochrome cycles.
