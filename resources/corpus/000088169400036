Dispersive multiplexing in multimode optical fiber
Recently developed ideas in the field of wireless communications suggest that the presence of scattering can be used to enhance, rather than degrade, the total information capacity of a transmission system. This concept is applied to data transmission over multimode optical fiber, and the result is an optical multiplexing that can increase the capacity of such fiber. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of this approach. The technique may play an important role in future high-bandwidth local area networking applications.
