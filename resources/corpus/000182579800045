Synthesis of inorganic fullerene-like molecules
The reaction of [Cp*Fe(eta(5)-P-5)] with Cu(I)Cl in solvent mixtures of CH2Cl2/CH3CN leads to the formation of entirely inorganic fullerene-like molecules of the formula [{Cp*Fe(eta(5):eta(1):eta(1):eta(1):eta(1):eta(1)-P-5)}(12){CuCl}(10){Cu2Cl3}(5){Cu(CH3CN)(2)}(5)] (1) possessing 90 inorganic core atoms. This compound represents a structural motif similar to that of C-60: cyclo-P-5 rings of [Cp*Fe(eta(5)-P-5)] molecules are surrounded by six-membered P4Cu2 rings that result from the coordination of each of the phosphorus lone pairs to CuCl metal centers, which are further coordinated by P atoms of other cyclo-P-5 rings. Thus, five- and six-membered rings alternate in a manner comparable to that observed in the fullerene molecules. The so-formed half shells are joined by [Cu2Cl3](-) as well as by [Cu(CH3CN)(2)](+) units. The spherical body has an inside diameter of 1.25 nanometers and an outside diameter of 2.13 nanometers, which is about three times as large as that of C-60.
