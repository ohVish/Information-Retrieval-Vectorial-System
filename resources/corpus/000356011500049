High-performance photovoltaic perovskite layers fabricated through intramolecular exchange
The band gap of formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI(3)) perovskites allows broader absorption of the solar spectrum relative to conventional methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI(3)). Because the optoelectronic properties of perovskite films are closely related to film quality, deposition of dense and uniform films is crucial for fabricating high-performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). We report an approach for depositing high-quality FAPbI(3) films, involving FAPbI(3) crystallization by the direct intramolecular exchange of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) molecules intercalated in PbI2 with formamidinium iodide. This process produces FAPbI(3) films with (111)-preferred crystallographic orientation, large-grained dense microstructures, and flat surfaces without residual PbI2. Using films prepared by this technique, we fabricated FAPbI(3)-based PSCs with maximum power conversion efficiency greater than 20%.
