Impacts of atmospheric anthropogenic nitrogen on the open ocean
Increasing quantities of atmospheric anthropogenic fixed nitrogen entering the open ocean could account for up to about a third of the ocean's external (nonrecycled) nitrogen supply and up to similar to 3% of the annual new marine biological production, similar to 0.3 petagram of carbon per year. This input could account for the production of up to similar to 1.6 teragrams of nitrous oxide (N2O) per year. Although similar to 10% of the ocean's drawdown of atmospheric anthropogenic carbon dioxide may result from this atmospheric nitrogen fertilization, leading to a decrease in radiative forcing, up to about two-thirds of this amount may be offset by the increase in N2O emissions. The effects of increasing atmospheric nitrogen deposition are expected to continue to grow in the future.
