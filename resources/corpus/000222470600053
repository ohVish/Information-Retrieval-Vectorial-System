Frontal and stealth attack strategies in microbial pathogenesis
Interactions between microbes and human hosts can range from a benign, even symbiotic collaboration to a competition that may turn fatal-resulting in death of the host, the microbe or both. Despite advances that have been made over the past decades in understanding microbial pathogens, more people worldwide still die every year from infectious disease than from any other cause. This highlights the relevance of continuing to probe the mechanisms used by microorganisms to cause disease, and emphasizes the need for new model systems to advance our understanding of host-pathogen interactions.
