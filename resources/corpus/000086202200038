Hot and dry deep crustal xenoliths from Tibet
Anhydrous metasedimentary and mafic xenoliths entrained in 3-million-year-old shoshonitic Lavas of the central Tibetan Plateau record a thermal gradient reaching about 800 degrees to 1000 degrees C at a depth of 30 to 50 kilometers; just before extraction, these same xenoliths were heated as much as 200 degrees C, Although these rocks show that the central Tibetan crust is hot enough to cause even dehydration melting of mica, the absence of hydrous minerals, and the match of our calculated P-wave speeds and Poisson's ratios with seismological observations, argue against the presence of widespread crustal melting.
