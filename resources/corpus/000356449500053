Endocytic sites mature by continuous bending and remodeling of the clathrin coat
During clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), plasma membrane regions are internalized to retrieve extracellular molecules and cell surface components. Whether endocytosis occurs by direct clathrin assembly into curved lattices on the budding vesicle or by initial recruitment to flat membranes and subsequent reshaping has been controversial. To distinguish between these models, we combined fluorescence microscopy and electron tomography to locate endocytic sites and to determine their coat and membrane shapes during invagination. The curvature of the clathrin coat increased, whereas the coated surface area remained nearly constant. Furthermore, clathrin rapidly exchanged at all stages of CME. Thus, coated vesicle budding appears to involve bending of a dynamic preassembled clathrin coat.
