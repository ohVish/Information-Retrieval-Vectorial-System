Regulation of homeostatic chemokine expression and cell trafficking during immune responses
The chemokines CCL21 and CXCL13 are immune factors that dictate homing and motility of lymphocytes and dendritic cells in lymphoid tissues. However, the means by which these chemokines are regulated and how they influence cell trafficking during immune responses remain unclear. We show that CCL21 and CXCL13 are transiently down-regulated within lymphoid tissues during immune responses by a mechanism controlled by the cytokine interferon-gamma. This modulation was found to alter the localization of lymphocytes and dendritic cells within responding lymphoid tissues. As a consequence, priming of T cell responses to a second distinct pathogen after chemokine modulation became impaired. We propose that this transient chemokine modulation may help orchestrate local cellularity, thus minimizing competition for space and resources in activated lymphoid tissues.
