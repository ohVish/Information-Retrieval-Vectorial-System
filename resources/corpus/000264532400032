Targeting the ubiquitin system in cancer therapy
The ubiquitin system is a network of proteins dedicated to the ubiquitylation of cellular targets and the subsequent control of numerous cellular functions. The deregulation of components of this elaborate network leads to human pathogenesis, including the development of many types of tumour. Alterations in the ubiquitin system that occur during the initiation and progression of cancer are now being uncovered, and this knowledge is starting to be exploited for both molecular diagnostics and the development of novel strategies to combat cancer.
