Selective and efficient platinum(0)-carbene complexes as hydrosilylation catalysts
The hydrosilylation reaction enables the production of silicon polymers. Platinum-carbene complexes are reported that catalyze the hydrosilylation reaction of alkenes with remarkable efficiency and exquisite selectivity and avoid the formation of platinum colloids. By-products, typically encountered with previous catalytic systems, are suppressed with these platinum derivatives.
