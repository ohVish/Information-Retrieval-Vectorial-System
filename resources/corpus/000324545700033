Influence of tumour micro-environment heterogeneity on therapeutic response
Tumour formation involves the co-evolution of neoplastic cells together with extracellular matrix, tumour vasculature and immune cells. Successful outgrowth of tumours and eventual metastasis is not determined solely by genetic alterations in tumour cells, but also by the fitness advantage such mutations confer in a given environment. As fitness is context dependent, evaluating tumours as complete organs, and not simply as masses of transformed epithelial cells, becomes paramount. The dynamic tumour topography varies drastically even throughout the same lesion. Heterologous cell types within tumours can actively influence therapeutic response and shape resistance.
