Generation of gut-homing IgA-secreting B cells by intestinal dendritic cells
Normal intestinal mucosa contains abundant immunoglobulin A (IgA) - secreting cells, which are generated from B cells in gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT). We show that dendritic cells ( DC) from GALT induce T cell - independent expression of IgA and gut-homing receptors on B cells. GALT-DC-derived retinoic acid (RA) alone conferred gut tropism but could not promote IgA secretion. However, RA potently synergized with GALT-DC-derived interleukin-6 (IL-6) or IL-5 to induce IgA secretion. Consequently, mice deficient in the RA precursor vitamin A lacked IgA-secreting cells in the small intestine. Thus, GALT-DC shape mucosal immunity by modulating B cell migration and effector activity through synergistically acting mediators.
