Experimental realization of noiseless subsystems for quantum information processing
We demonstrate the protection of one bit of quantum information against all collective noise in three nuclear spins. Because no subspace of states offers this protection, the quantum bit was encoded in a proper noiseless subsystem. We therefore realize a general and efficient method for protecting quantum information. Robustness was verified for a full set of noise operators that do not distinguish the spins. Verification relied on the most complete exploration of engineered decoherence to date. The achieved fidelities show improved information storage for a large, noncommutative set of errors.
