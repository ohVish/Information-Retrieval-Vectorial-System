Side-on copper-nitrosyl coordination by nitrite reductase
A copper-nitrosyl intermediate forms during the catalytic cycle of nitrite reductase, the enzyme that mediates the committed step in bacterial denitrification. The crystal structure of a type 2 copper-nitrosyl complex of nitrite reductase reveals an unprecedented side-on binding mode in which the nitrogen and oxygen atoms are nearly equidistant from the copper cofactor. Comparison of this structure with a refined nitrite-bound crystal structure explains how coordination can change between copper-oxygen and copper-nitrogen during catalysis. The side-on copper-nitrosyl in nitrite reductase expands the possibilities for nitric oxide interactions in copper proteins such as superoxide dismutase and prions.
