Quantum coherence in an exchange-coupled dimer of single-molecule magnets
A multi -high-frequency electron paramagnetic resonance method is used to probe the magnetic excitations of a dimer of single-molecule magnets. The measured spectra display well-resolved quantum transitions involving coherent superposition states of both molecules. The behavior may be understood in terms of an isotropic superexchange coupling between pairs of single-molecule magnets, in analogy with several recently proposed quantum devices based on artificially fabricated quantum dots or clusters. These findings highlight the potential utility of supramolecular chemistry in the design of future quantum devices based on molecular nanomagnets.
