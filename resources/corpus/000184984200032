Electric field effect in correlated oxide systems
Semiconducting field-effect transistors are the workhorses of the modern electronics era. Recently, application of the field-effect approach to compounds other than semiconductors has created opportunities to electrostatically modulate types of correlated electron behaviour-including high-temperature superconductivity and colossal magnetoresistance- and potentially tune the phase transitions in such systems. Here we provide an overview of the achievements in this field and discuss the opportunities brought by the field-effect approach.
