Entanglement Polytopes: Multiparticle Entanglement from Single-Particle Information
Entangled many-body states are an essential resource for quantum computing and interferometry. Determining the type of entanglement present in a system usually requires access to an exponential number of parameters. We show that in the case of pure, multiparticle quantum states, features of the global entanglement can already be extracted from local information alone. This is achieved by associating any given class of entanglement with an entanglement polytope-a geometric object that characterizes the single-particle states compatible with that class. Our results, applicable to systems of arbitrary size and statistics, give rise to local witnesses for global pure-state entanglement and can be generalized to states affected by low levels of noise.
