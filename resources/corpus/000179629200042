Regulation of oceanic silicon and carbon preservation by temperature control on bacteria
We demonstrated in laboratory experiments that temperature control of marine bacteria action on diatoms strongly influences the coupling of biogenic silica and organic carbon preservation. Low temperature intensified the selective regeneration of organic matter by marine bacteria as the silicon: carbon preservation ratio gradually increased from similar to1 at 33degreesC to similar to6 at -1.8degreesC. Temperature control of bacteria-mediated selective preservation of silicon versus carbon should help to interpret and model the variable coupling of silicon and carbon sinking fluxes and the spatial patterns of opal accumulation in oceanic systems with different temperature regimes.
