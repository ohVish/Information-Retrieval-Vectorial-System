Infall of gas as the formation mechanism of stars up to 20 times more massive than the Sun
Theory predicts and observations confirm that low-mass stars ( like the Sun) in their early life grow by accreting gas from the surrounding material. But for stars similar to 10 times more massive than the Sun (similar to 10M(.)), the powerful stellar radiation is expected to inhibit accretion1 and thus limit the growth of their mass. Clearly, stars with masses > 10M(.) exist, so there must be a way for them to form. The problem may be solved by non-spherical accretion(2,3), which allows some of the stellar photons to escape along the symmetry axis where the density is lower. The recent detection of rotating disks(4-6) and toroids(7) around very young massive stars has lent support to the idea that high- mass (greater than or similar to 8M(.)) stars could formin this way. Here we report observations of an ammonia line towards a high- mass star forming region. We conclude that the gas is falling inwards towards a very young star of similar to 20M(.), in line with theoretical predictions of non-spherical accretion.
