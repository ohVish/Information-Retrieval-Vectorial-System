An SCF-like ubiquitin ligase complex that controls presynaptic differentiation
During synapse formation, specialized subcellular structures develop at synaptic junctions in a tightly regulated fashion. Cross-signalling initiated by ephrins, Wnts and transforming growth factor-beta family members between presynaptic and postsynaptic termini are proposed to govern synapse formation(1-3). It is not well understood how multiple signals are integrated and regulated by developing synaptic termini to control synaptic differentiation. Here we report the identification of FSN-1, a novel F-box protein that is required in presynaptic neurons for the restriction and/or maturation of synapses in Caenorhabditis elegans. Many F-box proteins are target recognition subunits of SCF (Skp, Cullin, F-box) ubiquitin-ligase complexes(4-7). fsn-1 functions in the same pathway as rpm-1, a gene encoding a large protein with RING finger domains(8,9). FSN-1 physically associates with RPM-1 and the C. elegans homologues of SKP1 and Cullin to form a new type of SCF complex at presynaptic periactive zones. We provide evidence that T10H9.2, which encodes the C. elegans receptor tyrosine kinase ALK ( anaplastic lymphoma kinase(10)), may be a target or a downstream effector through which FSN-1 stabilizes synapse formation. This neuron-specific, SCF-like complex therefore provides a localized signal to attenuate presynaptic differentiation.
