Life at depth: Photobacterium profundum genome sequence and expression analysis
Deep-sea life requires adaptation to high pressure, an extreme yet common condition given that oceans cover 70% of Earth's surface and have an average depth of 3800 meters. Survival at such depths requires specific adaptation but, compared with other extreme conditions, high pressure has received little attention. Recently, Photobacterium profundum strain SS9 has been adopted as a model for piezophily. Here we report its genome sequence (6.4 megabase pairs) and transcriptome analysis. The results provide a first glimpse into the. molecular basis for life in the largest portion of the biosphere, revealing high metabolic versatility.
