Ultrafast optical control by few photons in engineered fiber
Fast control of a strong optical beam by a few photons is an outstanding challenge that limits the performance of quantum sensors and optical processing devices. We report that a fast and efficient optical gate can be realized in an optical fiber that has been engineered with molecular-scale accuracy. Highly efficient, distributed phase-matched photon-photon interaction was achieved in the fiber with locally controlled, nanometer-scale core variations. A three-photon input was used to manipulate a Watt-scale beam at a speed exceeding 500 gigahertz. In addition to very fast beam control, the results provide a path to developing a new class of sensitive receivers capable of operating at very high rates.
