Otolith delta O-18 record of mid-Holocene sea surface temperatures in Peru
Peruvian sea catfish (Galeichthys peruvianus) sagittal otoliths preserve a record of modern and mid-Holocene sea surface temperatures (SSTs). Oxygen isotope profiles in otoliths excavated from Ostra [6010 +/- 90 years before the present (yr B.P.); 8degrees55'S] indicate that summer SSTs were similar to3degreesC warmer than those of the present. Siches ototiths (6450 +/- 110 yr B.P.; 4degrees40'S) recorded mean annual temperatures similar to3degrees to 4degreesC warmer than were measured under modern conditions. Trophic level and population diversity and equitability data from these faunal assemblages and other Peruvian archaeological sites support the isotope interpretations and suggest that upwelling of the Peru-Chile current intensified after similar to5000 yr B.P.
