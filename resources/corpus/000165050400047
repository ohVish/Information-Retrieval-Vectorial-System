Telomere states and cell fates
Telomere length has frequently been used as a means to predict the future life of cells. But by itself it can be a poor indicator of ageing or cell viability. What, then, is the important property of a telomere? Here recent findings are integrated into a new, probabilistic view of the telomere to explain how and when it can signal not only its own fate but also that of a cell.
