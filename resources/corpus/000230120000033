Enols are common intermediates in hydrocarbon oxidation
Models for chemical mechanisms of hydrocarbon oxidation rely on spectrometric identification of molecular structures in flames. Carbonyl (keto) compounds are well-established combustion intermediates. However, their less-stable enol tautomers, bearing OH groups adjacent to carbon-carbon double bonds, are not included in standard models. We observed substantial quantities of two-, three-, and four-carbon enols by photoionization mass spectrometry of flames burning representative compounds from modern fuel blends. Concentration profiles demonstrate that enol flame chemistry cannot be accounted for purely by keto-enol tautomerization. Currently accepted hydrocarbon oxidation mechanisms will likely require revision to explain the formation and reactivity, of these unexpected compounds.
