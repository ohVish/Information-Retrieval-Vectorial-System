Listeria intracellular growth and virulence require host-derived lipoic acid
Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive intracytosolic pathogen that causes severe disease in pregnant and immunocompromised individuals. We found that L. monocytogenes lacking the lipoate protein ligase LplA1 was defective for growth specifically in the host cytosol and was less virulent in animals by a factor of 300. A major target for LplA1, the E2 subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), lacked a critical lipoyl modi. cation when the DeltalplA1 strain was grown intracellularly, which suggests that abortive growth was due to loss of PDH function. Thus, the use of host-derived lipoic acid may be a critical process for in vivo replication of bacterial pathogens.
