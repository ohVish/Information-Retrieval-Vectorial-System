Small Gold Clusters Formed in Solution Give Reaction Turnover Numbers of 10(7) at Room Temperature
Very small gold clusters (3 to 10 atoms) formed from conventional gold salts and complexes can catalyze various organic reactions at room temperature, even when present at concentrations of parts per billion. Absorption and emission ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry revealed that, for example, the ester-assisted hydration of alkynes began only when clusters of three to five gold atoms were formed. The turnover numbers and turnover frequencies associated with these catalyzed reactions can be as high as 10(7) and 10(5) per hour, respectively.
