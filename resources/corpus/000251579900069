The biological impact of mass-spectrometry-based proteomics
In the past decade, there have been remarkable advances in proteomic technologies. Mass spectrometry has emerged as the preferred method for in- depth characterization of the protein components of biological systems. Using mass spectrometry, key insights into the composition, regulation and function of molecular complexes and pathways have been gained. From these studies, it is clear that mass- spectrometry- based proteomics is now a powerful 'hypothesis- generating engine' that, when combined with complementary molecular, cellular and pharmacological techniques, provides a framework for translating large data sets into an understanding of complex biological processes.
