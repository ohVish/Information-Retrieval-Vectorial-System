Experimental verification of designer surface plasmons
We studied the microwave reflectivity of a structured, near perfectly conducting substrate that was designed to verify the existence of a theoretically proposed new class of surface mode. Measurements of the mode's dispersion curve show that it correctly approaches the predicted asymptotic frequency; the curve also agrees well with that derived from a computer simulation. Modeling of the field distribution on resonance provides evidence of strong localization of the electric field at the interface and substantial power flow along the interface, thus verifying the surface plasmon-like nature of the mode.
