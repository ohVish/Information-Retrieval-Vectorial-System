Cellular immune responses to HIV
The cellular immune response to the human immunodeficiency virus, mediated by T lymphocytes, seems strong but fails to control the infection completely. In most virus infections, T cells either eliminate the virus or suppress it indefinitely as a harmless, persisting infection. But the human immunodeficiency virus undermines this control by infecting key immune cells, thereby impairing the response of both the infected CD4(+) T cells and the uninfected CD8(+) T cells. The failure of the latter to function efficiently facilitates the escape of virus from immune control and the collapse of the whole immune system.
