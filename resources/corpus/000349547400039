Direct observation of bond formation in solution with femtosecond X-ray scattering
The making and breaking of atomic bonds are essential processes in chemical reactions. Although the ultrafast dynamics of bond breaking have been studied intensively using time-resolved techniques(1-3),, it is very difficult to study the structural dynamics of bond making, mainly because of its bimolecular nature. It is especially difficult to initiate and follow diffusion-limited bond formation in solution with ultrahigh time resolution. Here we use femtosecond time-resolved X-ray solution scattering to visualize the formation of a gold trimer complex, [Au(CN)(2)(-)](3) in real time without the limitation imposed by slow diffusion. This photoexcited gold trimer, which has weakly bound gold atoms in the ground state(4-6), undergoes a sequence of structural changes, and our experiments probe the dynamics of individual reaction steps, including covalent bond formation, the bent-to-linear transition, bond contraction and tetramer formation with a time resolution of 500 femtoseconds. We also determined the three-dimensional structures of reaction intermediates with sub-angstrom spatial resolution. This work demonstrates that it is possible to track in detail and in real time the structural changes that occur during a chemical reaction in solution using X-ray free-electron lasers' and advanced analysis of time-resolved solution scattering data.
