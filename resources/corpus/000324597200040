Glassy Dynamics in Condensed Isolated Polymer Chains
In the course of miniaturization down to the nanometer scale, much remains unknown concerning how and to what extent the properties of materials are changed. To learn more about the dynamics of condensed isolated polymer chains, we used broadband dielectric spectroscopy and a capacitor with nanostructured electrodes separated by 35 nanometers. We measured the dynamic glass transition of poly(2-vinylpyridine) and found it to be bulk-like; only segments closer than 0.5 nanometer to the substrate were weakly slowed. Our approach paves the way for numerous experiments on the dynamics of isolated molecules.
