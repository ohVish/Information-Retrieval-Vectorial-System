Human Mpp11 J protein: Ribosome-tethered molecular chaperones are ubiquitous
The existence of specialized molecular chaperones that interact directly with ribosomes is well established in microorganisms. Such proteins bind polypeptides exiting the ribosomal tunnel and provide a physical link between translation and protein folding. We report that ribosome-associated molecular chaperones have been maintained throughout eukaryotic evolution, as illustrated by Mpp11, the human ortholog of the yeast ribosome-associated J protein Zuo. When expressed in yeast, Mpp11 partially substituted for Zuo by partnering with the multipurpose Hsp70 Ssa, the homolog of mammalian Hsc70. We propose that in metazoans, ribosome-associated Mpp11 recruits the multifunctional soluble Hsc70 to nascent polypeptide chains as they exit the ribosome.
