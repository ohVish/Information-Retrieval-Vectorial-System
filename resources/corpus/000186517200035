A common origin for cosmic explosions inferred from calorimetry of GRB030329
Past studies(1-3) have suggested that long-duration gamma-ray bursts have a 'standard' energy of E(gamma)approximate to10(51) erg in the ultra-relativistic ejecta, after correcting for asymmetries in the explosion ('jets'). But a group of sub-energetic bursts, including the peculiar GRB980425 associated(4) with the supernova SN1998bw (E(gamma)approximate to10(48) erg), has recently been identified(2,3). Here we report radio observations of GRB030329 that allow us to undertake calorimetry of the explosion. Our data require a two-component explosion: a narrow (5degrees opening angle) ultra-relativistic component responsible for the gamma-rays and early afterglow, and a wide, mildly relativistic component that produces the radio and optical afterglow more than 1.5 days after the explosion. The total energy release, which is dominated by the wide component, is similar(1-3,5) to that of other gamma-ray bursts, but the contribution of the gamma-rays is energetically minor. Given the firm link(6,7) of GRB030329 with SN2003dh, our result indicates a common origin for cosmic explosions in which, for reasons not yet understood, the energy in the highest-velocity ejecta is extremely variable.
