Lymphotoxin beta receptor-dependent control of lipid homeostasis
Hyperlipidemia, one of the most important risk factors for coronary heart disease, is often associated with inflammation. We identified lymphotoxin ( LT) and LIGHT, tumor necrosis factor cytokine family members that are primarily expressed on lymphocytes, as critical regulators of key enzymes that control lipid metabolism. Dysregulation of LIGHT expression on T cells resulted in hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia. In low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient mice, which lack the ability to control lipid levels in the blood, inhibition of LT and LIGHT signaling with a soluble lymphotoxin beta receptor decoy protein attenuated the dyslipidemia. These results suggest that the immune system directly influences lipid metabolism and that LT modulating agents may represent a novel therapeutic route for the treatment of dyslipidemia.
