A proteolytic transmembrane signaling pathway and resistance to beta-lactams in staphylococci
beta -Lactamase and penicillin-binding protein Za mediate staphylococcal resistance to beta -lactam antibiotics, which are otherwise highly clinically effective. Production of these inducible proteins is regulated by a signal-transducing integral membrane protein and a transcriptional repressor. The signal transducer is a fusion protein with penicillin-binding and zinc metalloprotease domains. The signal for protein expression is transmitted by site-specific proteolytic cleavage of both the transducer, which autoactivates, and the repressor, which is inactivated, unblocking gene transcription. Compounds that disrupt this regulatory pathway could restore the activity of beta -lactam antibiotics against drug-resistant strains of staphylococci.
