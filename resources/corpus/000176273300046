Ferroelectric Bi3.25La0.75Ti3O12 films of uniform a-axis orientation on silicon substrates
The use of bismuth-layered perovskite films for planar-type nonvolatile ferroelectric random-access memories requires films with spontaneous polarization normal to the plane of growth. Epitaxially twinned a axis-oriented La-substituted Bi4Ti3O12 (BLT) thin films whose spontaneous polarization is entirely along the film normal were grown by pulsed laser deposition on yttria-stabilized zirconia-buffered Si(100) substrates using SrRuO3 as bottom electrodes. Even though the (118) orientation competes with the (100) orientation, epitaxial films with almost pure (100) orientation were grown using very thin, strained SrRuO3 electrode layers and kinetic growth conditions, including high growth rates and high oxygen background pressures to facilitate oxygen incorporation into the growing film. Films with the a-axis orientation and having their polarization entirely along the direction normal to the film plane can achieve a remanent polarization of 32 microcoulombs per square centimeter.
