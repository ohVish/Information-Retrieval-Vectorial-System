Multigenerational cortical inheritance of the Rax2 protein in orienting polarity and division in yeast
Diploid yeast cells repeatedly polarize and bud from their poles, probably because of highly stable marks of unknown composition. Here, Rax2, a membrane protein, was shown to behave as such a mark. The Rax2 protein itself was inherited immutably at the cell cortex for multiple generations, and Rax2 was shown to have a half-life exceeding several generations. The persistent inheritance of cortical protein markers would provide a means to couple a cell's history to the future development of a precise morphogenetic form.
