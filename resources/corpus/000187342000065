An ABC transporter with a secondary-active multidrug translocator domain
Multidrug resistance, by which cells become resistant to multiple unrelated pharmaceuticals, is due to the extrusion of drugs from the cell's interior by active transporters such as the human multidrug resistance beta-glycoprotein(1). Two major classes of transporters mediate this extrusion(2,3). Primary-active transporters are dependent on ATP hydrolysis, whereas secondary-active transletters porters are driven by electrochemical ion gradients that exist across the plasma membrane. The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter LmrA(4) is a primary drug transporter in Lactococcus lactis that can functionally substitute for P-glycoprotein in lung fibroblast cells(5). Here we have engineered a truncated LmrA protein that lacks the ATP-binding domain. Surprisingly, this truncated protein mediates a proton-ethidium symport reaction without the requirement for ATP. In other words, it functions as a secondary-active multidrug uptake system. These findings suggest that the evolutionary precursor of LmrA was a secondary-active substrate translocator that acquired an ATP-binding domain to enable primary-active multidrug efflux in L. lactis.
