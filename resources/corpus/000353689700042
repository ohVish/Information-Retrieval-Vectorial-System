Structure of the human 80S ribosome
Ribosomes are translational machineries that catalyse protein synthesis. Ribosome structures from various species are known at the atomic level, but obtaining the structure of the human ribosome has remained a challenge; efforts to address this would be highly relevant with regard to human diseases. Here we report the near-atomic structure of the human ribosome derived from high-resolution single-particle cryo-eiecfron microscopy and atomic model, building. The structure has an average resolution of 3.6 angstrom, reaching 2.9 angstrom resolution in the most stable regions. It provides unprecedented insights into ribosomal RNA entities and amino acid side chains, notably of the transfer RNA binding sites and specific molecular interactions with the exit site tRINA. It reveals atomic details of the subunit interface, which is seen to remodel strongly upon rotational movements of the ribosomal submits. Furthermore, the structure paves the way for analysing antibiotic side effects and diseases associated with deregulated protein synthesis.
