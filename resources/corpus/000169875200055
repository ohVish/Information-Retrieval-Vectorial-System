Developmental changes due to long-distance movement of a homeobox fusion transcript in tomato
Long-distance movement of RNA through the phloem is known to occur, but the functional importance of these transported RNAs has remained unclear. Crafting experiments with a naturally occurring dominant gain-of-function Leaf mutation in tomato were used to demonstrate long-distance movement of mutant messenger RNA (mRNA) into wild-type scions. The stock-specific pattern of mRNA expression was graft transmissible, indicating that the mRNA accumulation pattern is inherent to the transcript and not attributable to the promoter. The translocated mRNA caused changes in Leaf morphology of the wild-type scions, suggesting that the translocated RNA is functional.
