Radar observations of asteroid 216 Kleopatra
Radar observations of the main-belt, M-class asteroid 216 Kleopatra reveal a dumbbell-shaped object with overall dimensions of 217 kilometers by 94 kilometers by 81 kilometers (+/-25%). The asteroid's surface properties are consistent with a regolith having a metallic composition and a porosity comparable to that of Lunar soil. Kleopatra's shape is probably the outcome of an exotic sequence of collisional events, and much of its interior may have an unconsolidated rubble-pile structure.
