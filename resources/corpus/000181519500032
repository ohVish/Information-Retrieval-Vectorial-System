The impact of nanoscience on heterogeneous catalysis
Most catalysts consist of nanometer-sized particles dispersed on a high-surface-area support. Advances in characterization methods have led to a molecular-level understanding of the relationships between nanoparticle properties and catalytic performance. Together with novel approaches to nanoparticle synthesis, this knowledge is contributing to the design and development of new catalysts.
