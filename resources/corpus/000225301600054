The human polyomavirus, JCV, uses serotonin receptors to infect cells
The human polyomavirus, JCV, causes the fatal demyelinating disease progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in immunocompromised patients. We found that the serotonergic receptor SHT2AR could act as the cellular receptor for JCV on human glial cells. The SHT2A receptor antagonists inhibited JCV infection, and monoclonal antibodies directed at 5HT(2A) receptors blocked infection of glial cells by JCV, but not by SV40. Transfection of 5HT(2A) receptor-negative HeLa cells with a 5HT(2A) receptor rescued virus infection, and this infection was blocked by antibody to the 5HT(2A) receptor. A tagged SHT2A receptor colocalized with labeled JCV in an endosomal compartment following internalization. Serotonin receptor antagonists may thus be useful in the treatment of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.
