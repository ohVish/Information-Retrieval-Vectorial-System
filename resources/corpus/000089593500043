Quantum Hall ferromagnetism in a two-dimensional electron system
Experiments on a nearly spin degenerate two-dimensional electron system reveals unusual hysteretic and relaxational transport in the fractional quantum Hall effect regime. The transition between the spin-polarized (with fill fraction nu = 1/3) and spin-unpolarized (nu = 2/5) states is accompanied by a complicated series of hysteresis. loops reminiscent of a classical, ferromagnet, In correlation with the hysteresis, magnetoresistance can either grow or decay Logarithmically in time with remarkable persistence and does not saturate. In contrast to the established models of relaxation, the relaxation rate exhibits an anomalous divergence as temperature is reduced. These results indicate the presence of novel two-dimensional ferromagnetism with a complicated magnetic domain dynamic.
