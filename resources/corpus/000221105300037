In-plane spectral weight shift of charge carriers in YBa2Cu3O6.9
The temperature-dependent redistribution of the spectral weight of the CuO2 plane-derived conduction band of the YBa2 Cu-3 O-6.9 high-temperature superconductor (superconducting transition temperature = 92.7 kelvin) was studied with wide-band (0.01- to 5.6-electron volt) spectroscopic ellipsometry. A superconductivity-induced transfer of the spectral weight involving a high-energy scale in excess of 1 electron volt was observed. Correspondingly, the charge carrier spectral weight was shown to decrease in the superconducting state. The ellipsometric data also provide detailed information about the evolution of the optical self-energy in the normal and superconducting states.
