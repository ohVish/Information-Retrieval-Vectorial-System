Millennial-scale dynamics of southern Amazonian rain forests
Amazonian rain forest-savanna boundaries are highly sensitive to climatic change and may also play an important role in rain forest speciation. However, their dynamics over millennial time scales are poorly understood. Here, we present late Quaternary pollen records from the southern margin of Amazonia, which show that the humid evergreen rain forests of eastern Bolivia have been expanding southward over the past 3000 years and that their present-day Limit represents the southernmost extent of Amazonian rain forest over at Least the past 50,000 years. This rain forest expansion is attributed to increased seasonal Latitudinal migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, which can in turn be explained by Milankovitch astronomic forcing.
