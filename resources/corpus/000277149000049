IL25 elicits a multipotent progenitor cell population that promotes T(H)2 cytokine responses
CD4(+) T helper 2 (T(H)2) cells secrete interleukin (IL)4, IL5 and IL13, and are required for immunity to gastrointestinal helminth infections(1). However, T(H)2 cells also promote chronic inflammation associated with asthma and allergic disorders(2). The nonhaematopoietic-cell-derived cytokines thymic stromal lymphopoietin, IL33 and IL25 (also known as IL17E) have been implicated in inducing T(H)2 cell-dependent inflammation at mucosal sites(3-6), but how these cytokines influence innate immune responses remains poorly defined. Here we show that IL25, a member of the IL17 cytokine family, promotes the accumulation of a lineage-negative (Lin(-)) multipotent progenitor (MPP) cell population in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue that promotes T(H)2 cytokine responses. The IL25-elicited cell population, termed MPPtype2 cells, was defined by the expression of Sca-1 (also known as Ly6a) and intermediate expression of c-Kit (c-Kit(int)), and exhibited multipotent capacity, giving rise to cells of monocyte/macrophage and granulocyte lineages both in vitro and in vivo. Progeny of MPPtype2 cells were competent antigen presenting cells, and adoptive transfer of MPPtype2 cells could promote T(H)2 cytokine responses and confer protective immunity to helminth infection in normally susceptible Il25(-/-) mice. The ability of IL25 to induce the emergence of an MPPtype2 cell population identifies a link between the IL17 cytokine family and extramedullary haematopoiesis, and suggests a previously unrecognized innate immune pathway that promotes T(H)2 cytokine responses at mucosal sites.
