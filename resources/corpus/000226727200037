Regulation of cap-dependent translation by eIF4E inhibitory proteins
Eukaryotic messenger RNAs contain a modified guanosine, termed a cap, at their 50 ends. Translation of mRNAs requires the binding of an initiation factor, eIF4E, to the cap structure. Here, we describe a family of proteins that through a shared sequence regulate cap-dependent translation. The biological importance of this translational regulation is immense, and affects such processes as cell growth, development, oncogenic transformation and perhaps even axon pathfinding and memory consolidation.
