Enzymatic activation of voltage-gated potassium channels
Voltage- gated ion channels in excitable nerve, muscle, and endocrine cells generate electric signals in the form of action potentials(1). However, they are also present in non- excitable eukaryotic cells and prokaryotes, which raises the question of whether voltage- gated channels might be activated by means other than changing the voltage difference between the solutions separated by the plasma membrane. The search for so- called voltage- gated channel activators is motivated in part by the growing importance of such agents in clinical pharmacology. Here we report the apparent activation of voltage- gated K+ ( Kv) channels by a sphingomyelinase.
