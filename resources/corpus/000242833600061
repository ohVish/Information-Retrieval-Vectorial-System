Nitrogen fixation at 92 degrees C by a hydrothermal vent archaeon
A methanogenic archaeon isolated from deep-sea hydrothermal vent fluid was found to reduce N-2 to NH3 at up to 92 degrees C, which is 28 degrees C higher than the current upper temperature limit of biological nitrogen fixation. The 16S ribosomal RNA gene of the hyperthermophilic nitrogen fixer, designated FS406-22, was 99% similar to that of non-nitrogen fixing Methanocaldococcus jannaschii DSM 2661. At its optimal growth temperature of 90 degrees C, FS406-22 incorporated N-15(2) and expressed nifH messenger RNA. This increase in the temperature limit of nitrogen fixation could reveal a broader range of conditions for life in the subseafloor biosphere and other nitrogen-limited ecosystems than previously estimated.
