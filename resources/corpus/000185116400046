beta-arrestin 2 mediates endocytosis of type III TGF-beta receptor and down-regulation of its signaling
beta-Arrestins bind to activated seven transmembrane-spanning (7TMS) receptors (G protein-coupled receptors) after the receptors are phosphorylated by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), thereby regulating their signaling and internalization. Here, we demonstrate an unexpected and analogous role of beta-arrestin 2 (betaarr2) for the single transmembrane-spanning type III transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor (TbetaRIII, also referred to as betaglycan). Binding of betaarr2 to TbetaRIII was also triggered by phosphorylation of the receptor on its cytoplasmic domain (likely at threonine 841). However, such phosphorylation was mediated by the type II TGF-beta receptor (TbetaRII), which is itself a kinase, rather than by a GRK. Association with betaarr2 led to internalization of both receptors and down-regulation of TGF-beta signaling. Thus, the regulatory actions of beta-arrestins are broader than previously appreciated, extending to the TGF-beta receptor family as well.
