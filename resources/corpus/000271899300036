Human genetics illuminates the paths to metabolic disease
Metabolic diseases represent a growing threat to world-wide public health. In general, these disorders result from the interaction of heritable factors with environmental influences. Here, I will focus on two important metabolic disorders, namely type 2 diabetes and obesity, and explore the extent to which human molecular genetic research has illuminated our understanding of their underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.
