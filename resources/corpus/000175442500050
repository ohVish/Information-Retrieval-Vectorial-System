Enhanced and delayed stress-induced alcohol drinking in mice lacking functional CRH1 receptors
There is a relation between stress and alcohol drinking. We show that the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) system that mediates endocrine and behavioral responses to stress plays a role in the control of long-term alcohol drinking. In mice lacking a functional CRH1 receptor, stress leads to enhanced and progressively increasing alcohol intake. The effect of repeated stress on alcohol drinking behavior appeared with a delay and persisted throughout life. It was associated with an up-regulation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit NR2B. Alterations in the CRH1 receptor gene and adaptional changes in NR2B subunits may constitute a genetic risk factor for stress-induced alcohol drinking and alcoholism.
