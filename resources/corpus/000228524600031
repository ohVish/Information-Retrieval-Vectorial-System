No high-mass protostars in the silhouette young stellar object M17-S01
The birth of very massive stars is not well understood(1-3), in contrast to the formation process of low-mass stars like our Sun(4,5). It is not even clear that massive stars can form as single entities; rather, they might form through the mergers of smaller ones born in tight groups(6,7). The recent claim of the discovery of a massive protostar in M17 (a nearby giant ionized region) forming through the same mechanism as low-mass stars(8) has therefore generated considerable interest. Here we show that this protostar has an intermediate mass of only 2.5 to 8 solar masses (M.), contrary to the earlier claim of 20. (ref. 8). The surrounding circumstellar envelope contains only 0.09M. and a much more extended local molecular cloud has 4-9M..
