Genome sequence of a 45,000-year-old modern human from western Siberia
We present the high-quality genome sequence of a similar to 45,000-year-old modern human male from Siberia. This individual derives from a population that lived before-or simultaneously with-the separation of the populations in western and eastern Eurasia and carries a similar amount of Neanderthal ancestry as present-day Eurasians. However, the genomic segments of Neanderthal ancestry are substantially longer than those observed in present-day individuals, indicating that Neanderthal gene flow into the ancestors of this individual occurred 7,000-13,000 years before he lived. We estimate an autosomal mutation rate of 0.4 x 10(-9) to 0.6 x 10(-9) per site per year, a Y chromosomal mutation rate of 0.7 x 10(-9) to 0.9 x 10(-9) per site per year based on the additional substitutions that have occurred in present-day non-Africans compared to this genome, and a mitochondrial mutation rate of 1.8 x 10(-8) to 3.2 x 10(-8) per site per year based on the age of the bone.
