A thermodynamic explanation for black smoker temperatures
There is a remarkable difference between the maximum temperature of black smoker effluent (350 degrees C-400 degrees C) and the temperature of the solidifying magma which heats it (similar to 1,200 degrees C)(1-3). It has been suspected(4) for some time that the nonlinear thermodynamic properties of water(5) might be responsible for this discrepancy. Here, we translate this hypothesis into a physical model, by examining the internal temperature structure of convection cells in a porous medium. We demonstrate that, at pressures appropriate to seafloor crust, plumes of pure water form naturally at similar to 400 degrees C for any heat source with temperature greater than similar to 500 degrees C. Higher temperatures are confined to a boundary layer at the base of the convection cell, where the flow is horizontal. The phenomenon is explained analytically using the thermodynamic properties of water, and is illustrated by numerical simulations. Our model predicts the existence of the high-temperature 'reaction zone' found in ophiolites" and suggests that vent temperatures will remain steady as magma chambers solidify and cool(7).
