Contact-dependent inhibition of growth in Escherichia coli
Bacteria have developed mechanisms to communicate and compete with each other for Limited environmental resources. We found that certain Escherichia coli, including uropathogenic strains, contained. a bacterial growth-inhibition system that uses direct cell-to-cell contact. Inhibition was conditional, dependent upon the growth state of the inhibitory cell and the pili expression state of the target cell. Both a large cell-surface protein designated Contact-dependent inhibitor A (CdiA) and two-partner secretion family member CdiB were required for growth inhibition. The CdiAB system may function to regulate the growth of specific cells within a differentiated bacterial population.
