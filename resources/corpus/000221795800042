Stomatal development and pattern controlled by a MAPKK kinase
Stomata are epidermal structures that modulate gas exchange between a plant and its environment. During development, stomata are specified and positioned nonrandomly by the integration of asymmetric cell divisions and intercellular signaling. The Arabidopsis mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase gene, YODA, acts as part of a molecular switch controlling cell identities in the epidermis. Null mutations in YODA lead to excess stomata, whereas constitutive activation of YODA eliminated stomata. Transcriptome analysis of seedlings with altered YODA activity was used to identify potential stomatal regulatory genes. A putative transcription factor from this set was shown to regulate the developmental behavior of stomatal precursors.
