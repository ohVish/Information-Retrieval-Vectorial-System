The chemical repertoire of natural ribozymes
Although RNA is generally thought to be passive genetic blueprint, some RNA molecules, called ribozymes, have intrinsic enzyme-like activity-they can catalyse chemical reactions in the complete absence of protein cofactors. In addition to the well-known small ribozymes that cleave phosphoclester bonds, we now know that RNA catalysts probably effect a number of key cellular reactions. This versatility has lent credence to the idea that RNA molecules may have been central to the early stages of life on Earth.
