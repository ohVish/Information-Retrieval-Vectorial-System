Generation of Leaf Shape Through Early Patterns of Growth and Tissue Polarity
A major challenge in biology is to understand how buds comprising a few cells can give rise to complex plant and animal appendages like leaves or limbs. We address this problem through a combination of time-lapse imaging, clonal analysis, and computational modeling. We arrive at a model that shows how leaf shape can arise through feedback between early patterns of oriented growth and tissue deformation. Experimental tests through partial leaf ablation support this model and allow reevaluation of previous experimental studies. Our model allows a range of observed leaf shapes to be generated and predicts observed clone patterns in different species. Thus, our experimentally validated model may underlie the development and evolution of diverse organ shapes.
