Distance communication transfer of HIV prevention interventions to service providers
Most acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) service providers are in countries with little access to scientific developments relevant to their programs. It is critical to transfer advances from the scientific arena to service providers on a global scale. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention organizations in 78 countries were randomized to receive either a control condition or a technology transfer condition with an interactive distance learning computer training curriculum and individualized distance consultation. Of 42 nongovernmental organizations in the technology transfer condition, 29 adopted the science-based program in their communities or trained other agencies to also use it. Advanced communication technologies can create a cost-effective infrastructure to disseminate new intervention models to service providers worldwide.
