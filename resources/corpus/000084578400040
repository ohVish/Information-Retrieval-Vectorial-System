The Galactic center: An interacting system of unusual sources
The region bounded by the inner tens of light-years at the center of the Milky Way Galaxy contains five principal components that coexist within the central deep well of gravitational potential These constituents are a black hole candidate (Sgr A*) with a mass equivalent to 2.6 +/- 0.2 x 10(6) solar masses, a surrounding cluster of evolved stars, a complex of young stars, molecular and ionized gas clouds. and a powerful supernova-like remnant. The interaction of these components is responsible for many of the phenomena occurring in this complex and unique portion of the Galaxy. Developing a consistent picture of the primary interactions between the components at the Galactic center will improve our understanding of the nature of galactic nuclei in general, and will provide us with a better-defined set of characteristics of black holes. For example, the accretion of stellar winds by Sgr A* appears to produce far Less radiation than indicated by estimates based on models of galactic nuclei.
