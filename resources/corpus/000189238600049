A putative Ca2+ and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase required for bacterial and fungal symbioses
Legumes can enter into symbiotic relationships with both nitrogen-fixing bacteria ( rhizobia) and mycorrhizal fungi. Nodulation by rhizobia results from a signal transduction pathway induced in legume roots by rhizobial Nod factors. DMI3, a Medicago truncatula gene that acts immediately downstream of calcium spiking in this signaling pathway and is required for both nodulation and mycorrhizal infection, has high sequence similarity to genes encoding calcium and calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CCaMKs). This indicates that calcium spiking is likely an essential component of the signaling cascade leading to nodule development and mycorrhizal infection, and sheds light on the biological role of plant CCaMKs.
