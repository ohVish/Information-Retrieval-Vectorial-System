Adapting proteostasis for disease intervention
The protein components of eukaryotic cells face acute and chronic challenges to their integrity. Eukaryotic protein homeostasis, or proteostasis, enables healthy cell and organismal development and aging and protects against disease. Here, we describe the proteostasis network, a set of interacting activities that maintain the health of proteome and the organism. Deficiencies in proteostasis lead to many metabolic, oncological, neurodegenerative, and cardiovascular disorders. Small- molecule or biological proteostasis regulators that manipulate the concentration, conformation, quaternary structure, and/ or the location of protein( s) have the potential to ameliorate some of the most challenging diseases of our era.
