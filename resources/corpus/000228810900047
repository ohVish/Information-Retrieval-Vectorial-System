Enhanced diapycnal mixing by salt fingers in the thermocline of the tropical Atlantic
Diapycnal mixing plays a significant role in the ocean's circulation and uptake of heat and carbon dioxide, but has not been quantified in salt finger-driven thermohaline staircases. We recently performed a tracer release experiment in the western tropical Atlantic staircase at similar to 400 m depth. The observed dispersion implies an effective diapycnal diffusivity for tracer and salt of 0.8 to 0.9 x 10(-4) m(2)/s. Temperature microstructure data interpreted in terms of a vertical production-dissipation balance yields a smaller effective diffusivity for heat of 0.45 (+/- 0.2) x 10(-4) m(2)/s, consistent with salt fingers and well above the mixing ascribable to mechanical turbulence.
