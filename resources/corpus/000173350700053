Abnormal vascular function and hypertension in mice deficient in estrogen receptor beta
Blood vessels express estrogen receptors, but their rote in cardiovascular physiology is not wet[ understood. We show that vascular smooth muscle cells and blood vessels from estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta)-deficient mice exhibit multiple functional abnormalities. In wild-type mouse blood vessels, estrogen attenuates vasoconstriction by an ERbeta-mediated increase in inducible nitric oxide synthase expression. In contrast, estrogen augments vasoconstriction in blood vessels from ERbeta-deficient mice. Vascular smooth muscle cells isolated from ERbeta-deficient mice show multiple abnormalities of ion channel function. Furthermore, ERbeta-deficient mice develop sustained systolic and diastolic hypertension as they age. These data support an essential role for ERbeta in the regulation of vascular function and blood pressure.
