An infrared flash contemporaneous with the gamma-rays of GRB 041219a
The explosion that results in a cosmic gamma-ray burst (GRB) is thought to produce emission from two physical processes: the central engine gives rise to the high-energy emission of the burst through internal shocking(1), and the subsequent interaction of the flow with the external environment produces long-wavelength afterglows(2-4). Although observations of afterglows(5) continue to refine our understanding of GRB progenitors and relativistic shocks, gamma-ray observations alone have not yielded a clear picture of the origin of the prompt emission(6) nor details of the central engine. Only one concurrent visible-light transient has been found(7) and it was associated with emission from an external shock. Here we report the discovery of infrared emission contemporaneous with a GRB, beginning 7.2 minutes after the onset of GRB 041219a ( ref. 8). We acquired 21 images during the active phase of the burst, yielding early multi-colour observations. Our analysis of the initial infrared pulse suggests an origin consistent with internal shocks.
