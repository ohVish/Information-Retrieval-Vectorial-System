Presynaptic glycine receptors enhance transmitter release at a mammalian central synapse
Glycine and GABA(A) (gamma -aminobutyric acid A) receptors are inhibitory neurotransmitter-gated Cl- channels localized in postsynaptic membranes. In some cases, GABA(A) receptors are also found presynaptically, but they retain their inhibitory effect as their activation reduces excitatory transmitter release(1-4). Here we report evidence for presynaptic ionotropic glycine receptors, using pre- and postsynaptic recordings of a calyceal synapse in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB). Unlike the classical action of glycine, presynaptic glycine receptors triggered a weakly depolarizing Cl- current in the nerve terminal. The depolarization enhanced transmitter release by activating Ca2+ channels and increasing resting intraterminal Ca2+ concentrations. Repetitive activation of glycinergic synapses on MNTB neurons also enhanced glutamatergic synaptic currents, indicating that presynaptic glycine receptors are activated by glycine spillover. These results reveal a novel site of action of the transmitter glycine, and indicate that under certain conditions presynaptic Cl- channels may increase transmitter release.
