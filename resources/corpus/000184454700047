Dimers of the N-terminal domain of phytochrome B are functional in the nucleus
A plant modulates its developmental processes in response to light by several informational photoreceptors such as phytochrome. Phytochrome is a dimeric chromoprotein which regulates various aspects of plant development from seed germination to flowering(1). Upon absorption of red light, phytochrome translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus(2-4), and regulates gene expression through interaction with transcription factors such as PIF3 (refs 5-7). The phytochrome polypeptide has two domains(1,8) : the amino-terminal photosensory domain with a chromophore and the carboxy-terminal domain which contains signalling motifs such as a kinase domain(9). The latter is widely believed to transduce the signal to downstream components(1,5,810). Here we show that the C-terminal domain of Arabidopsis phytochrome B (phyB), which is known as the most important member of the phytochrome family(1), is not directly involved in signal transduction. The N-terminal domain isolated from phyB, when dimerized and localized in the nucleus, triggered full phyB responses with much higher photosensitivity than the full-length phyB. These findings indicate that the C-terminal domain attenuates the activity of phyB rather than positively transducing the signal.
