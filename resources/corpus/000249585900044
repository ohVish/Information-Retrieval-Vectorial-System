Asymmetric catalysis of the transannular Diels-Alder reaction
Transannular chemical reactions are unparalleled in their ability to generate high degrees of stereochemical and architectural complexity in a single transformation. However, the successful application of this approach in synthesis depends on the ability to predict and control the outcome of the transannular reaction. Use of a chiral catalyst in this context represents an attractive, yet unused, strategy. This report describes a catalytic, asymmetric transannnular Diels-Alder (TADA) reaction that affords polycyclic products in high enantiomeric excess. This catalyst system can also alter the inherent diastereoselectivity of cyclizations with substrates containing chiral centers. Additionally, the catalytic enantioselective TADA has been used as the key step in a total synthesis of the sesquiterpene 11,12-diacetoxydrimane; this route may provide a general approach to the polycyclic carbon framework shared by many terpene natural products.
