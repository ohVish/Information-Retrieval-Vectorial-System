Polarization mode control of two-dimensional photonic crystal laser by unit cell structure design
We demonstrate polarization mode selection in a two-dimensional (2D) photonic crystal laser by controlling the geometry of the unit cell structure. As the band diagram of the square-lattice photonic crystal is influenced by the unit cell structure, calculations reveal that changing the structure from a circular to an elliptical geometry should result in a strong modification of the electromagnetic field distributions at the band edges. Such a structural modification is expected to provide a mechanism for controlling the polarization modes of the emitted light. A square-lattice photonic crystal with the elliptical unit cell structure has been fabricated and integrated with a gain media. The observed coherent 2D lasing action with a single wavelength and controlled polarization is in good agreement with the predicted behavior.
