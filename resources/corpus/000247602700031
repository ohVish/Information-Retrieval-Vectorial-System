Non-Fermi liquid metal without quantum criticality
A key question in condensed matter physics concerns whether pure three-dimensional metals can always be described as Fermi liquids. Using neutron Larmor diffraction to overcome the traditional resolution limit of diffraction experiments, we studied the lattice constants of the cubic itinerant-electron magnet manganese silicide (MnSi) at low temperatures and high pressures. We were able to resolve the nature of the phase diagram of MnSi and to establish that a stable, extended non-Fermi liquid state emerges under applied pressure without quantum criticality. This suggests that new forms of quantum order may be expected even far from quantum phase transitions.
