Order of Magnitude Smaller Limit on the Electric Dipole Moment of the Electron
The Standard Model of particle physics is known to be incomplete. Extensions to the Standard Model, such as weak-scale supersymmetry, posit the existence of new particles and interactions that are asymmetric under time reversal (T) and nearly always predict a small yet potentially measurable electron electric dipole moment (EDM), d(e), in the range of 10(-27) to 10(-30) e.cm. The EDM is an asymmetric charge distribution along the electron spin ((S) over right arrow) that is also asymmetric under T. Using the polar molecule thorium monoxide, we measured d(e) = (-2.1 +/- 3.7(stat) +/- 2.5(syst)) x 10(-29) e.cm. This corresponds to an upper limit of vertical bar d(e)vertical bar < 8.7 x 10(-29) e.cm with 90% confidence, an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity relative to the previous best limit. Our result constrains T-violating physics at the TeV energy scale.
