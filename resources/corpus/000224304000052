Src mediates a switch from microtubule- to actin-based motility of vaccinia virus
The cascade of events that leads to vaccinia-induced actin polymerization requires Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the viral membrane protein A36R. We found that a localized outside-in signaling cascade induced by the viral membrane protein B5R is required to potently activate Src and induce A36R phosphorylation at the plasma membrane. In addition, Src-mediated phosphorylation of A36R regulated the ability of virus particles to recruit and release conventional kinesin. Thus, Src activity regulates the transition between cytoplasmic microtubule transport and actin-based motility at the plasma membrane.
