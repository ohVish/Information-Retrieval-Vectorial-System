Fusion of cells by flipped SNAREs
The SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) hypothesis suggests that pairs of proteins known as vesicle (v-) SNAREs and target membrane (t-) SNAREs interact specifically to control and mediate intracellular membrane fusion events. Here, cells expressing the interacting domains of v- and t- SNAREs on the cell surface were found to fuse spontaneously, demonstrating that SNAREs are sufficient to fuse biological membranes.
