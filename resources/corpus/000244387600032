Ex situ NMR in highly homogeneous fields: H-1 spectroscopy
Portable single-sided nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) magnets used for nondestructive studies of large samples are believed to generate inherently inhomogeneous magnetic fields. We demonstrated experimentally that the field of an open magnet can be shimmed to high homogeneity in a large volume external to the sensor. This technique allowed us to measure localized high-resolution proton spectra outside a portable open magnet with a spectral resolution of 0.25 part per million. The generation of these experimental conditions also simplifies the implementation of such powerful methodologies as multidimensional NMR spectroscopy and imaging.
