Recognition of a ubiquitous self antigen by prostate cancer-infiltrating CD8(+) T lymphocytes
Substantial evidence exists that many tumors can be specifically recognized by CD8(+) T lymphocytes. The definition of antigens targeted by these cells is paramount for the development of effective immunotherapeutic strategies for treating human cancers. In a screen for endogenous tumor- associated T cell responses in a primary mouse model of prostatic adenocarcinoma, we identified a naturally arising CD8(+) T cell response that is reactive to a peptide derived from histone H4. Despite the ubiquitous nature of histones, T cell recognition of histone H4 peptide was specifically associated with the presence of prostate cancer in these mice. Thus, the repertoire of antigens recognized by tumor- infiltrating T cells is broader than previously thought and includes peptides derived from ubiquitous self antigens that are normally sequestered from immune detection.
