Structural basis for ribosome recruitment and manipulation by a viral IRES RNA
Canonical cap - dependent translation initiation requires a large number of protein factors that act in a stepwise assembly process. In contrast, internal ribosomal entry sites (IRESs) are cis-acting RNAs that in some cases completely supplant these factors by recruiting and activating the ribosome using a single structured RNA. Here we present the crystal structure of the ribosome-binding domain from a Dicistroviridae intergenic region IRES at 3.1 angstrom resolution, providing a view of the prefolded architecture of an all-RNA translation initiation apparatus. Docking of the structure into cryo - electron microscopy reconstructions of an IRES-ribosome complex suggests a model for ribosome manipulation by a dynamic IRES RNA.
