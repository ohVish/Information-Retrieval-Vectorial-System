Synthesis, Structure, and Reactivity of an Iron(V) Nitride
Despite being implicated as important intermediates, iron(V) compounds have proven very challenging to isolate and characterize. Here, we report the preparation of the iron(V) nitrido complex, [PhB((t)BuIm)(3)Fe(V) N]BAr(F24) (PhB((t)BuIm)(3)(-) = phenyltris(3-tert-butylimidazol-2-ylidene)borato, BAr(F24) = B(3,5-(CF(3))(2)C(6)H(3))(4)(-)), by one electron oxidation of the iron(IV) nitrido precursor. Single-crystal x-ray diffraction of the iron(V) complex reveals a four-coordinate metal ion with a terminal nitrido ligand. Mossbauer and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopic characterization, supported by electronic structure calculations, provide evidence for a d(3) iron(V) metal center in a low spin (S = 1/2) electron configuration. Low-temperature reaction of the iron(V) nitrido complex with water under reducing conditions leads to high yields of ammonia with concomitant formation of an iron(II) species.
