Economic incentives for rain forest conservation across scales
Globally, tropical deforestation releases 20 to 30% of anthropogenic green-house gases. Conserving forests could reduce emissions, but the cost-effectiveness of this mechanism for mitigation depends on the associated opportunity costs. We estimated these costs from local, national, and global perspectives using a case study from Madagascar, Conservation generated significant benefits over logging and agriculture Locally and globally. Nationally, however, financial benefits from industrial logging were Larger than conservation benefits. Such differing economic signals across scales may exacerbate tropical deforestation. The Kyoto Protocol could potentially overcome this obstacle to conservation by creating markers for protection of tropical forests to mitigate climate change.
