Molecular code for transmembrane-helix recognition by the Sec61 translocon
Transmembrane alpha-helices in integral membrane proteins are recognized co-translationally and inserted into the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum by the Sec61 translocon. A full quantitative description of this phenomenon, linking amino acid sequence to membrane insertion efficiency, is still lacking. Here, using in vitro translation of a model protein in the presence of dog pancreas rough microsomes to analyse a large number of systematically designed hydrophobic segments, we present a quantitative analysis of the position- dependent contribution of all 20 amino acids to membrane insertion efficiency, as well as of the effects of transmembrane segment length and flanking amino acids. The emerging picture of translocon- mediated transmembrane helix assembly is simple, with the critical sequence characteristics mirroring the physical properties of the lipid bilayer.
