Atomlike, hollow-core-bound molecular orbitals of C-60
The atomic electron orbitals that underlie molecular bonding originate from the central Coulomb potential of the atomic core. We used scanning tunneling microscopy and density functional theory to explore the relation between the nearly spherical shape and unoccupied electronic structure of buckminsterfullerene ( C-60) molecules adsorbed on copper surfaces. Besides the known pi* antibonding molecular orbitals of the carbon- atom framework, above 3.5 electron volts we found atomlike orbitals bound to the core of the hollow C-60 cage. These "superatom" states hybridize like the s and p orbitals of hydrogen and alkali atoms into diatomic molecule- like dimers and free- electron bands of one- dimensional wires and two- dimensional quantum wells in C-60 aggregates. We attribute the superatom states to the central potential binding an electron to its screening charge, a property expected for hollow- shell molecules derived from layered materials.
