Nanometre-scale electronics with III-V compound semiconductors
For 50 years the exponential rise in the power of electronics has been fuelled by an increase in the density of silicon complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) transistors and improvements to their logic performance. But silicon transistor scaling is now reaching its limits, threatening to end the microelectronics revolution. Attention is turning to a family of materials that is well placed to address this problem: group III-V compound semiconductors. The outstanding electron transport properties of these materials might be central to the development of the first nanometre-scale logic transistors.
