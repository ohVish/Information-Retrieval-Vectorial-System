The PP2A-associated protein alpha 4 is an essential inhibitor of apoptosis
Despite evidence that protein kinases are regulators of apoptosis, a specific role for phosphatases in regulating cell survival has not been established. Here we show that alpha4, a noncatalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), is required to repress apoptosis in murine cells. alpha4 is a nonredundant regulator of the dephosphorylation of the transcription factors c-jun and p53. As a result of alpha4 deletion, multiple proapoptotic genes were transcribed. Either inhibition of new protein synthesis or Bcl-x(L) overexpression Suppressed apoptosis initiated by alpha4 deletion. Thus, mammalian cell viability depends on repression of transcription-initiated apoptosis mediated by a component of PP2A.
