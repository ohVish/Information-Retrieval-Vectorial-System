Hydrogen clusters in clathrate hydrate
High-pressure Raman, infrared, x-ray, and neutron studies show that H-2 and H2O mixtures crystallize into the sII clathrate structure with an approximate H-2/H2O molar ratio of 1:2. The clathrate cages are multiply occupied, with a cluster of two H-2 molecules in the small cage and four in the large cage. Substantial softening and splitting of hydrogen vibrons indicate increased intermolecular interactions. The quenched clathrate is stable up to 145 kelvin at ambient pressure. Retention of hydrogen at such high temperatures could help its condensation in planetary nebulae and may play a key role in the evolution of icy bodies.
