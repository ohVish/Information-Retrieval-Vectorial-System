Electron solvation in two dimensions
Ultrafast two-photon photoemission has been used to study electron solvation at two-dimensional metal/polar-adsorbate interfaces. The molecular motion that causes the excess electron solvation is manifested as a dynamic shift in the electronic energy. Although the initially excited electron is delocalized in the plane of the interface, interactions with the adsorbate can lead to its localization. A method for determining the spatial extent of the localized electron in the plane of the interface has been developed. This spatial extent was measured to be on the order of a single adsorbate molecule.
