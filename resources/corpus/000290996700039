Electrically Induced Ferromagnetism at Room Temperature in Cobalt-Doped Titanium Dioxide
The electric field effect in ferromagnetic semiconductors enables switching of the magnetization, which is a key technology for spintronic applications. We demonstrated electric field-induced ferromagnetism at room temperature in a magnetic oxide semiconductor, (Ti,Co)O(2), by means of electric double-layer gating with high-density electron accumulation (>10(14) per square centimeter). By applying a gate voltage of a few volts, a low-carrier paramagnetic state was transformed into a high-carrier ferromagnetic state, thereby revealing the considerable role of electron carriers in high-temperature ferromagnetism and demonstrating a route to room-temperature semiconductor spintronics.
