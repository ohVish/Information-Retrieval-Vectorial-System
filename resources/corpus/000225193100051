Reversible Immunocontraception in mate monkeys immunized with Eppin
Various forms of birth control have been developed for women; however, there are currently few options for men. The development of mate contraceptives that are effective, safe, and reversible is desired for family planning throughout the world. We now report contraception of mate nonhuman primates (Macaca radiata) immunized with Eppin, a testis/epididymis-specific protein. Seven out of nine mates (78%) developed high titers to Eppin, and A of these high-titer monkeys were infertile. Five out of seven (71%) high-anti-Eppin titer mates recovered fertility when immunization was stopped. This study demonstrates that effective and reversible mate immunocontraception is an attainable goal. This method of immunocontraception may be extended to humans.
