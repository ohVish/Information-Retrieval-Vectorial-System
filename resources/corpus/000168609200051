Single crystals of single-walled carbon nanotubes formed by self-assembly
We report the self-assembly of single crystals of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) using thermolysis of nano-patterned precursors. The synthesis of these perfectly ordered, single crystals of SWCNTs results in extended structures with dimension on the micrometer scale. Each crystal is composed of an ordered array of tubes with identical diameters and chirality, although these properties vary between crystals. The results show that SWCNTs can be produced as a perfect bulk material on the micrometer scale and point toward the synthesis of bulk macroscopic crystalline material.
