Dynamic personalities of proteins
Because proteins are central to cellular function, researchers have sought to uncover the secrets of how these complex macromolecules execute such a fascinating variety of functions. Although static structures are known for many proteins, the functions of proteins are governed ultimately by their dynamic character ( or 'personality'). The dream is to 'watch' proteins in action in real time at atomic resolution. This requires addition of a fourth dimension, time, to structural biology so that the positions in space and time of all atoms in a protein can be described in detail.
