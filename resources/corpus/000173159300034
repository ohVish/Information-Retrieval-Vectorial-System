A faint discrete source origin for the highly ionized iron emission from the Galactic Centre region
The origin of the X-ray emission for the central region of our Galaxy has remained a mystery(1-4). In particular, the relative spectral contributions of the diffuse emission and discrete sources, which are critical to understanding the high-energy phenomena in this environment, have been unclear because of the lack of sufficient spatial resolution. Here we report the results of a large-scale imaging survey of the Galactic Centre that resolves these components. We rnd that the Ka emission from iron that has been highly ionized (so that it has only two electrons left), which has previously been attributed to the diffuse component(1), actually arises mainly from discrete sources. This suggests that the presence of a large amount of hot gas (T approximate to 10(8) K) is no longer required to explain the iron line emission. The spectra of the discrete sources indicate the presence of numerous accreting white dwarfs, neutron stars, and/or black holes in the region. The diffuse emission dominates over the contribution from the faint point sources, and is shown to be associated globally with interstellar features that have been observed at radio and midinfrared wavelengths, suggesting that it is the product of recent massive star formation.
