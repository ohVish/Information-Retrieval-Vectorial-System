Protein function in the post-genomic era
Faced with the avalanche of genomic sequences and data on messenger RNA expression, biological scientists are confronting a frightening prospect: piles of information but only flakes of knowledge. How can the thousands of sequences being determined and deposited, and the thousands of expression profiles being generated by the new array methods, be synthesized into useful knowledge? What form will this knowledge take? These are questions being addressed by scientists in the field known as 'functional genomics'.
