Coherent atomic motions in a nanostructure studied by femtosecond x-ray diffraction
Reversible structural changes of a nanostructure were measured non-destructively with subpicometer spatial and subpicosecond temporal resolution via x-ray diffraction (XRD). The spatially periodic femtosecond excitation of a gallium arsenide/aluminum gallium arsenide superlattice results in coherent lattice motions with a 3.5-picosecond period, which was directly monitored by femtosecond x-ray pulses at a 1-kilohertz repetition rate. Small changes (DeltaR/R=0.01) of weak Bragg reflexes (R=0.005) were detected. The phase and amplitude of the oscillatory XRD signal around a new equilibrium demonstrate that displacive excitation of the zone-folded acoustic phonons is the dominant mechanism for strong excitation.
