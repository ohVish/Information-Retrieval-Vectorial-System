Myocyte renewal and ventricular remodelling
Remaining young at heart is a desirable but elusive goal. Unbeknown to us, however, myocyte regeneration may accomplish just that. Continuous cell renewal in the adult myocardium was thought to be impossible, but multipotent cardiac stem cells may be able to renew the myocardium and, under certain circumstances, can be coaxed to repair the broken heart after infarction.
