The involvement of RNA in ribosome function
The ribosome is a particle made of RNA and protein that is found in abundance in all cells that are actively making protein. It catalyses the messenger RNA-directed synthesis of proteins. Recent structural work has demonstrated a profound involvement of the ribosome's RNA component in all aspects of its function, supporting the hypothesis that proteins were added to the ribosome late in its evolution.
