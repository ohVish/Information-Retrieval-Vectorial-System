Surface self-organization caused by dislocation networks
We report a new mechanism of self-organization that can lead to robust surface ordering. We have quantitatively analyzed the thermal motion of holes created by sulfur atoms in a silver monolayer on a ruthenium surface, which we observed in real time with scanning tunneling microscopy. We find that the stability of the array of holes is determined by the arrangement and structure of misfit dislocations in the film.
