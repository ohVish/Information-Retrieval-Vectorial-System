Blockade of RAGE-amphoterin signalling suppresses tumour growth and metastases
The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), a multi-ligand member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell surface molecules(1-2), interacts with distinct molecules implicated in homeostasis, development and inflammation, and certain diseases such as diabetes and Alzheimer's disease(3-8). Engagement of RAGE by a ligand triggers activation of key cell signalling pathways, such as p21(ras), MAP kinases, NF-kappa B and cdc42/rac, thereby reprogramming cellular properties(9-11). RAGE is a central cell surface receptor for amphoterin, a polypeptide linked to outgrowth of cultured cortical neurons derived from developing brain(3,12-15). Indeed, the co-localization of RAGE and amphoterin at the leading edge of advancing neurites indicated their potential contribution to cellular migration, and in pathologies such as tumour invasion. Here we demonstrate that blockade of RAGE-amphoterin decreased growth and metastases of both implanted tumours and tumours developing spontaneously in susceptible mice. Inhibition of the RAGE-amphoterin interaction suppressed activation of p44/p42, p38 and SAP/JNK MAP kinases; molecular effector mechanisms importantly linked to tumour proliferation, invasion and expression of matrix metalloproteinases(16-23).
