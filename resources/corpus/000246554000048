Hd3a protein is a mobile flowering signal in rice
Florigen, the mobile signal that moves from an induced leaf to the shoot apex and causes flowering, has eluded identification since it was first proposed 70 years ago. Understanding the nature of the mobile flowering signal would provide a key insight into the molecular mechanism floral induction. Recent studies suggest that the Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS T ( FT) gene is a candidate for encoding florigen. We show that the protein encoded by Hd3a, a rice ortholog of moves from the leaf to the shoot apical meristem and induces flowering in rice. These results suggest that the Hd3a protein may be the rice florigen.
