Catalytically active Au-O(OH)(x)-species stabilized by alkali ions on zeolites and mesoporous oxides
We report that the addition of alkali ions (sodium or potassium) to gold on KLTL-zeolite and mesoporous MCM-41 silica stabilizes mononuclear gold in Au-O(OH)(x)-(Na or K) ensembles. This single-site gold species is active for the low-temperature (<200 degrees C) water-gas shift (WGS) reaction. Unexpectedly, gold is thus similar to platinum in creating -O linkages with more than eight alkali ions and establishing an active site on various supports. The intrinsic activity of the single-site gold species is the same on irreducible supports as on reducible ceria, iron oxide, and titania supports, apparently all sharing a common, similarly structured gold active site. This finding paves the way for using earth-abundant supports to disperse and stabilize precious metal atoms with alkali additives for the WGS and potentially other fuel-processing reactions.
