Restoration of degraded tropical forest landscapes
The current scale of deforestation in tropical regions and the large areas of degraded lands now present underscore the urgent need,for interventions to restore biodiversity, ecological functioning, and the supply of goods and ecological services previously used by poor rural communities. Traditional timber plantations have supplied some goods but have made only minor contributions to fulfilling most of these other objectives. New approaches to reforestation are now emerging, with potential for both overcoming forest degradation and addressing rural poverty.
