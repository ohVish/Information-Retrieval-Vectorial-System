Submicrometer ferromagnetic NOT gate and shift register
An all-metallic submicrometer device is demonstrated experimentally at room temperature that performs logical NOT operations on magnetic logic signals. When this two-terminal ferromagnetic structure is incorporated into a magnetic feedback loop, the junction performs a frequency division operation on an applied oscillating magnetic field. Up to 11 of these junctions are then directly linked together to create a magnetic shift register.
