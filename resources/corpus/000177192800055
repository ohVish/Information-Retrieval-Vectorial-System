Ectodermal Wnt function as a neural crest inducer
Neural crest cells, which generate peripheral nervous system and facial skeleton, arise at the neural plate/ectodermal border via an inductive interaction between these tissues. Wnts and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play roles in neural crest induction in amphibians and zebrafish. Here, we show that, in avians, Wnt6 is localized in ectoderm and in vivo inhibition of Wnt signaling perturbs neural crest formation. Furthermore, Wnts induce neural crest from naive neural plates in vitro in a defined medium without added factors, whereas BMPs require additives. Our data suggest that Wnt molecules are necessary and sufficient to induce neural crest cells in avian embryos.
