Control of nutrient-sensitive transcription programs by the unconventional prefoldin URI
Prefoldins (PFDs) are members of a recently identified, small-molecular weight protein family able to assemble into molecular chaperone complexes. Here we describe an unusually large member of this family, termed URI, that forms complexes with other small-molecular weight PFDs and with RPB5, a shared subunit of all three RNA polymerases. Functional analysis of the yeast and human orthologs of URI revealed that both are targets of nutrient signaling and participate in gene expression controlled by the TOR kinase. Thus, URI is a component of a signaling pathway that coordinates nutrient availability with gene expression.
