Quantum electronic stability of atomically uniform films
We have studied the structural stability of thin silver films with thicknesses of N = 1 to 15 monolayers, deposited on an Fe(100) substrate. Photoemission spectroscopy results show that films of N = 1, 2, and 5 monolayer thicknesses are structurally stable for temperatures above 800 kelvin, whereas films of other thicknesses are unstable and bifurcate into a film with N +/- 1 monolayer thicknesses at temperatures around 400 kelvin, The results are in agreement with theoretical predictions that consider the electronic energy of the quantum well associated with a particular film thickness as a significant contribution-to the film stability.
