RAD51C is required for Holliday junction processing in mammalian cells
During genetic recombination and the recombinational repair of chromosome breaks, DNA molecules become linked at points of strand exchange. Branch migration and resolution of these crossovers, or Holliday junctions (HJs), complete the recombination process. Here, we show that extracts from cells carrying mutations in the recombination/repair genes RAD51C or XRCC3 have reduced levels of HJ resolvase activity. Moreover, depletion of RAD51C from fractionated human extracts caused a loss of branch migration and resolution activity, but these functions were restored by complementation with a variety of RAD51 paralog complexes containing RAD51C. We conclude that the RAD51 paralogs are involved in HJ processing in human cells.
