Synaptic integration mediated by striatal cholinergic interneurons in basal ganglia function
The physiological role of striatal cholinergic interneurons was investigated with immunotoxin-mediated cell targeting (IMCT). Unilateral cholinergic cell ablation caused an acute abnormal turning behavior. These mice showed gradual recovery but displayed abnormal turning by both excess stimulation and inhibition of dopamine actions. In the acute phase, basal ganglia function was shifted to a hyperactive state by stimulation and suppression of striatonigral and striatopallidal neurons, respectively. D1 and D2 dopamine receptors were then down-regulated, relieving dopamine-predomimant synaptic perturbation but leaving a defect in controlling dopamine responses. The acetylcholine-dopamine interaction is concertedly and adaptively regulated for basal ganglia synaptic integration.
