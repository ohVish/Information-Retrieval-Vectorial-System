Asteroseismology of HD 129929: Core overshooting and nonrigid rotation
We have gathered and analyzed 1493 high-quality multicolor Geneva photometric data taken over 21 years of the B3V star HD 129929. We detect six frequencies, among which appear the effects of rotational splitting with a spacing of similar to0.0121 cycles per day, which implies that the star rotates very slowly. A nonadiabatic analysis of the oscillations allows us to constrain the metallicity of the star to Z is an element of[0.017,0.022], which agrees with a similar range derived from spectroscopic data. We provide evidence for the occurrence of core convective overshooting in the star, with alpha(ov) = 0.10 +/- 0.05, and we rule out rigid rotation.
