The glass-to-glass transition and its end point in a copolymer micellar system
We present experimental evidence, obtained from small-angle neutron scattering and photon correlation measurements, indicating the existence of two types of structurally arrested (glassy) states in a copolymer micellar system with a short-range interparticle attractive interaction. Within a certain range of micellar volume fractions, a sharp transition between these two types of glass is observed by varying the temperature. Furthermore, we found an end point of this transition line beyond which the two glasses become identical in their local structure and their long-time dynamics. These findings confirm the recent mode-coupling theory predictions regarding the phase behavior of the structurally arrested states for this type of system.
