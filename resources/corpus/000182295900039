Role of Polo-like kinase CDC5 in programming meiosis I chromosome segregation
Meiosis is a specialized cell division in which two chromosome segregation phases follow a single DNA replication phase. The budding yeast Polo-like kinase Cdc5 was found to be instrumental in establishing the meiosis I chromosome segregation program. Cdc5 was required to phosphorylate and remove meiotic cohesin from chromosomes. Furthermore, in the absence of CDC5 kinetochores were bioriented during meiosis I, and Mam1, a protein essential for coorientation, failed to associate with kinetochores. Thus, sister-kinetochore coorientation and chromosome segregation during meiosis I are coupled through their dependence on CDC5.
