Extension of life-span by loss of CHICO, a Drosophila insulin receptor substrate protein
The Drosophila melanogaster gene chico encodes an insulin receptor substrate that functions in an insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathway. in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, insulin/IGF signaling regulates adult longevity. We found that mutation of chico extends fruit fly median Life-span by up to 48% in homozygotes and 36% in heterozygotes. Extension of Life-span was not a result of impaired oogenesis in chico females, nor was it consistently correlated with increased stress resistance. The dwarf phenotype of chico homozygotes was also unnecessary for extension of Life-span. The role of insulin/IGF signaling in regulating animal aging is therefore evolutionarily conserved.
