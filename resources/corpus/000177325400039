Dipole moments of highly vibrationally excited water
The intensity of water absorption in the region of the solar spectrum plays a dominant role in atmospheric energy balance and hence strongly influences climate. Significant controversy exists over how to model this absorption accurately. We report dipole moment measurements of highly vibrationally excited water, which provide stringent tests of intensities determined by other means. Our measurements and accompanying calculations suggest that the best currently available potential and dipole surfaces do not accurately model intensities in the optical spectrum of water.
