Signaling to the nucleus by an L-type calcium channel - Calmodulin complex through the MAP kinase pathway
Increases in the intracellutar concentration of calcium ([Ca2+](i)) activate various signaling pathways that lead to the expression of genes that are essential for dendritic development, neuronal. survival, and synaptic plasticity. The mode of Ca2+ entry into a neuron plays a key rote in determining which signaling pathways are activated and thus specifies the cellular response to Ca2+. Ca2+ influx through L-type voltage-activated channels (LTCs) is particularly effective at activating transcription factors such as CREB and MEF-2. We developed a functional knock-in technique to investigate the features of LTCs that specifically couple them to the signaling pathways that regulate gene expression. We found that an isoleucine-glutamine ("IQ") motif in the carboxyl terminus of the LTC that binds Ca2+-calmodutin (CaM) is critical for conveying the Ca2+ signal to the nucleus. Ca2+-CaM binding to the LTC was necessary for activation of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which conveys local Ca2+ signals from the mouth of the LTC to the nucleus. CaM functions as a local Ca2+ sensor at the mouth of the LTC that activates the MAPK pathway and leads to the stimulation of genes that are essential for neuronal survival and plasticity.
