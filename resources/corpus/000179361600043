Fluorometric detection of enzyme activity with synthetic supramolecular pores
The reversible blockage of synthetic pores formed by rigid-rod beta barrels, either by substrates or products, was used to sense a variety of enzymatic reactions in high-throughput format with "naked-eye" fluorescent detection. Improvement of sensor sensitivity beyond three orders of magnitude by straightforward internal mutations underscores the functional plasticity of rigid-rod beta barrels. Such detectors of enzyme activity with the aforementioned characteristics are needed in areas as diverse as proteomics and environmentally benign organic synthesis.
