Magnetoelectric domain control in multiferroic TbMnO3
The manipulation of domains by external fields in ferroic materials is of major interest for applications. In multiferroics with strongly coupled magnetic and electric order, however, the magnetoelectric coupling on the level of the domains is largely unexplored. We investigated the field-induced domain dynamics of TbMnO3 in the multiferroic ground state and across a first-order spin-flop transition. In spite of the discontinuous nature of this transition, the reorientation of the order parameters is deterministic and preserves the multiferroic domain pattern. Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert simulations reveal that this behavior is intrinsic. Such magnetoelectric correlations in spin-driven ferroelectrics may lead to domain wall-based nanoelectronics devices.
