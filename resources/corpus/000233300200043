Nanofabricated media with negative permeability at visible frequencies
A great deal of attention has recently been focused on a new class of smart materials-so-called left-handed media-that exhibit highly unusual electromagnetic properties and promise new device applications(1-6). Left-handed materials require negative permeability m, an extreme condition that has so far been achieved only for frequencies in the microwave to terahertz range(7-11). Extension of the approach described in ref. 7 to achieve the necessary high-frequency magnetic response in visible optics presents a formidable challenge(12-15), as no material-natural or artificial-is known to exhibit any magnetism at these frequencies. Here we report a nanofabricated medium consisting of electromagnetically coupled pairs of gold dots with geometry carefully designed at a 10-nm level. The medium exhibits a strong magnetic response at visible-light frequencies, including a band with negative m. The magnetism arises owing to the excitation of an antisymmetric plasmon resonance. The high-frequency permeability qualitatively reveals itself via optical impedance matching. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of engineering magnetism at visible frequencies and pave the way towards magnetic and left-handed components for visible optics.
