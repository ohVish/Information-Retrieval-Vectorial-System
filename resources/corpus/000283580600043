Transferable GaN Layers Grown on ZnO-Coated Graphene Layers for Optoelectronic Devices
We fabricated transferable gallium nitride (GaN) thin films and light-emitting diodes (LEDs) using graphene-layered sheets. Heteroepitaxial nitride thin films were grown on graphene layers by using high-density, vertically aligned zinc oxide nanowalls as an intermediate layer. The nitride thin films on graphene layers show excellent optical characteristics at room temperature, such as stimulated emission. As one of the examples for device applications, LEDs that emit strong electroluminescence emission under room illumination were fabricated. Furthermore, the layered structure of a graphene substrate made it possible to easily transfer GaN thin films and GaN-based LEDs onto foreign substrates such as glass, metal, or plastic.
