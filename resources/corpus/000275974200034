Lessons on longevity from budding yeast
The past decade has seen fundamental advances in our understanding of the ageing process and raised optimism that interventions to slow ageing may be on the horizon. Studies of budding yeast have made immense contributions to this progress. Yeast longevity factors have now been shown to modulate ageing in invertebrate and mammalian models, and studies of yeast have resulted in some of the best candidates for anti-ageing drugs currently in development. The first interventions to slow human ageing may spring from the humble yeast.
