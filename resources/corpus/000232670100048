Basal anthropoids from Egypt and the antiquity of Africa's higher primate radiation
Early anthropoid evolution in Afro-Arabia is poorly documented, with only a few isolated teeth known from before similar to 35 million years ago. Here we describe craniodental remains of the primitive anthropoid Biretia from similar to 37-million-year-old rocks in Egypt. Biretia is unique among early anthropoids in exhibiting evidence for nocturnality, but derived dental features shared with younger parapithecids draw this genus, and possibly >45-million-year-old Algeripithecus, into a morphologically and behaviorally diverse parapithecoid clade of great antiquity.
