Thyroid hormone-dependent adult pigment cell lineage and pattern in zebrafish
Pigment patterns are useful for elucidating fundamental mechanisms of pattern formation and how these mechanisms evolve. In zebrafish, several pigment cell classes interact to generate stripes, yet the developmental requirements and origins of these cells remain poorly understood. Using zebrafish and a related species, we identified roles for thyroid hormone (TH) in pigment cell development and patterning, and in postembryonic development more generally. We show that adult pigment cells arise from distinct lineages having distinct requirements for TH and that differential TH dependence can evolve within lineages. Our findings demonstrate critical functions for TH in determining pigment pattern phenotype and highlight the potential for evolutionary diversification at the intersection of developmental and endocrine mechanisms.
