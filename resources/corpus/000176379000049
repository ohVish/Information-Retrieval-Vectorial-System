A continuous source of Bose-Einstein condensed atoms
A continuous source of Bose-Einstein condensed sodium atoms was created by periodically replenishing a condensate held in an optical dipole trap with new condensates delivered using optical tweezers. The source contained more than 1 x 10(6) atoms at all times, raising the possibility of realizing a continuous atom laser.
