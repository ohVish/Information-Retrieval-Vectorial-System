Architecture of the photosynthetic oxygen-evolving center
Photosynthesis uses light energy to drive the oxidation of water at an oxygen-evolving catalytic site within photosystem II ( PSII). We report the structure of PSII of the cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus at 3.5 angstrom resolution. We have assigned most of the amino acid residues of this 650-kilodalton dimeric multisubunit complex and refined the structure to reveal its molecular architecture. Consequently, we are able to describe details of the binding sites for cofactors and propose a structure of the oxygen-evolving center (OEC). The data strongly suggest that the OEC contains a cubane-like Mn3CaO4 cluster linked to a fourth Mn by a mono-mu-oxo bridge. The details of the surrounding coordination sphere of the metal cluster and the implications for a possible oxygen-evolving mechanism are discussed.
