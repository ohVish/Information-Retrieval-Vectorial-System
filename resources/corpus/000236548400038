Solution-processed silicon films and transistors
The use of solution processes - as opposed to conventional vacuum processes and vapour-phase deposition - for the fabrication of electronic devices has received considerable attention for a wide range of applications(1-7), with a view to reducing processing costs. In particular, the ability to print semiconductor devices using liquid-phase materials could prove essential for some envisaged applications, such as large-area flexible displays. Recent research in this area has largely been focused on organic semiconductors(8-11), some of which have mobilities comparable to that of amorphous silicon(11) (a-Si); but issues of reliability remain. Solution processing of metal chalcogenide semiconductors to fabricate stable and high-performance transistors has also been reported(12,13). This class of materials is being explored as a possible substitute for silicon, given the complex and expensive manufacturing processes required to fabricate devices from the latter. However, if high-quality silicon films could be prepared by a solution process, this situation might change drastically. Here we demonstrate the solution processing of silicon thin-film transistors (TFTs) using a silane-based liquid precursor. Using this precursor, we have prepared polycrystalline silicon ( poly-Si) films by both spin-coating and ink-jet printing, from which we fabricate TFTs with mobilities of 108 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) and 6.5 cm(2) V-1 s(-1), respectively. Although the processing conditions have yet to be optimized, these mobilities are already greater than those that have been achieved in solution-processed organic TFTs, and they exceed those of a-Si TFTs (<= 1 cm(2) V-1 s(-1)).
