The Trypanosoma cruzi proteome
To complement the sequencing of the three kinetoplastid genomes reported in this issue, we have undertaken a whole-organism, proteomic analysis of the four life-cycle stages of Trypanosoma cruzi. Peptides mapping to 2784 proteins in 1168 protein groups from the annotated T. cruzi genome were identified across the four life-cycte stages. Protein products were identified from >1000 genes annotated as "hypothetical" in the sequenced genome, including members of a newly defined gene family annotated, as mucin-associated surface proteins. The four parasite stages appear to use distinct energy sources, including histidine for stages present in the insect vectors and fatty acids by intracellular amastigotes.
