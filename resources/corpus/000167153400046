Centrosome-dependent exit of cytokinesis in animal cells
As an organelle coupling nuclear and cytoplasmic divisions, the centrosome is essential to mitotic fidelity, and its inheritance could be critical to understanding cell transformation. Investigating the behavior of the centrosome in Living mitotic cells, we documented a transient and remarkable postanaphase repositioning of this organelle, which apparently controls the release of central microtubules from the midbody and the completion of cell division. We also observed that the absence of the centrosome Leads to defects in cytokinesis. Together with recent results in yeasts, our data point to a conserved centrosome-dependent pathway that integrates spatial controls into the decision of completing cell division, which requires the repositioning of the centrosome organelle.
