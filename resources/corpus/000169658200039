Gene families from the Arabidopsis thaliana pollen coat proteome
The pollen extracellular matrix contains proteins mediating species specificity and components needed for efficient pollination. We identified all proteins >10 kilodaltons in the Arabidopsis pollen coating and showed that most of the corresponding genes reside in two genomic clusters. One cluster encodes six Lipases, whereas the other contains six lipid-binding oleosin genes, including GRP17, a gene that promotes efficient pollination. Individual oleosins exhibit extensive divergence between eco types, but the entire cluster remains intact. Analysis of the syntenic region in Brassica oleracea revealed even greater divergence, but a similar clustering of the genes. Such allelic flexibility may promote speciation in plants.
