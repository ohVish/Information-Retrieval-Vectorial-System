Connected to death: The (unexpurgated) mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis
The mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis in vertebrates is dependent on the process of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), which leads to the release of proteins from the mitochondrial intermembrane space into the cytosol. "Upstairs" of this event are the Bcl-2 family proteins that regulate and mediate MOMP; "downstairs" is the activation of caspases that orchestrate the dismantling of the cell. In the Connections Map database at Science's Signal Transduction Knowledge Environment (STKE), the pathways that define the mitochondrial pathway of apotosis are illustrated, with the bulk of control occurring. "upstairs" of MOMP.
