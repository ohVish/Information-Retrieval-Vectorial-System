Direct measurements of the convective recycling of the upper troposphere
We present a statistical representation of the aggregate effects of deep convection on the chemistry and dynamics of the upper troposphere ( UT) based on direct aircraft observations of the chemical composition of the UT over the eastern United States and Canada during summer. These measurements provide unique observational constraints on the chemistry occurring downwind of convection and the rate at which air in the UT is recycled. These results provide quantitative measures that can be used to evaluate global climate and chemistry models.
