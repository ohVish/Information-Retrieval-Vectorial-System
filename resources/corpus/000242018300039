The plant immune system
Many plant- associated microbes are pathogens that impair plant growth and reproduction. Plants respond to infection using a two- branched innate immune system. The first branch recognizes and responds to molecules common to many classes of microbes, including non- pathogens. The second responds to pathogen virulence factors, either directly or through their effects on host targets. These plant immune systems, and the pathogen molecules to which they respond, provide extraordinary insights into molecular recognition, cell biology and evolution across biological kingdoms. A detailed understanding of plant immune function will underpin crop improvement for food, fibre and biofuels production.
