Layer-Resolved Graphene Transfer via Engineered Strain Layers
The performance of optimized graphene devices is ultimately determined by the quality of the graphene itself. Graphene grown on copper foils is often wrinkled, and the orientation of the graphene cannot be controlled. Graphene grown on SiC(0001) via the decomposition of the surface has a single orientation, but its thickness cannot be easily limited to one layer. We describe a method in which a graphene film of one or two monolayers grown on SiC is exfoliated via the stress induced with a Ni film and transferred to another substrate. The excess graphene is selectively removed with a second exfoliation process with a Au film, resulting in a monolayer graphene film that is continuous and single-oriented.
