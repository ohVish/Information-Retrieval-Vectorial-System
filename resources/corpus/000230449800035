Single-electron delocalization in hybrid vertical-lateral double quantum dots
We used a hybrid vertical-lateral double-dot device, consisting of laterally coupled vertical quantum dots, to measure the interdot tunnel coupling. By using nonlinear transport measurements of "Coulomb diamonds," we showed that an inherent asymmetry in the capacitances of the component dots influences the diamond slopes, thereby allowing for the determination of the dot through which the electron has passed. We used this technique to prepare a delocalized one-electron state and Heitler-London (HL) two-electron state, and we showed that the interdot tunnel coupling, which determines whether HL is the ground state, is tunable. This implies that our device may be useful for implementing two-electron spin entanglement.
