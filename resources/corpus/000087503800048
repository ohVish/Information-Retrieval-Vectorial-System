Extinct I-129 in halite from a primitive meteorite: Evidence for evaporite formation in the early solar system
Halite crystals from the Zag H3-6 chondrite contain essentially pure (monoisotopic) xenon-129 (Xe-129) produced in the early history of the solar system by the decay of short-lived iodine-129 (I-129) (half-Life = 15.7 million years). Correlated release of Xe-129 and Xe-128, produced artificially from I-127 by neutron irradiation, corresponds to an initial (I-129/I-127) ratio of (1.35 +/- 0.05) x 10(-4), close to the most primitive early solar system value. If the Xe-129 was produced by in situ decay. then the halite formed from an aqueous fluid within 2 million years of the oldest known solar system minerals.
