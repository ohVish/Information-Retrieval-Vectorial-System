Latitudinal Gradients in Greenhouse Seawater delta O-18: Evidence from Eocene Sirenian Tooth Enamel
The Eocene greenhouse climate state has been linked to a more vigorous hydrologic cycle at mid-and high latitudes; similar information on precipitation levels at low latitudes is, however, limited. Oxygen isotopic fluxes track moisture fluxes and, thus, the delta O-18 values of ocean surface waters can provide insight into hydrologic cycle changes. The offset between tropical d18O values from sampled Eocene sirenian tooth enamel and modern surface waters is greater than the expected 1.0 per mil increase due to increased continental ice volume. This increased offset could result from suppression of surface-water delta O-18 values by a tropical, annual moisture balance substantially wetter than that of today. Results from an atmospheric general circulation model support this interpretation and suggest that Eocene low latitudes were extremely wet.
