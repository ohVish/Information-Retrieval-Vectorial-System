bicoid RNA localization requires specific binding of an endosomal sorting complex
bicoid messenger RNA localizes to the anterior of the Drosophila egg, where it is translated to form a morphogen gradient of Bicoid protein that patterns the head and thorax of the embryo. Although bicoid was the first localized cytoplasmic determinant to be identified(1-4), little is known about how the mRNA is coupled to the microtubule-dependent transport pathway that targets it to the anterior, and it has been proposed that the mRNA is recognized by a complex of many redundant proteins, each of which binds to the localization element in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) with little or no specificity(5). Indeed, the only known RNA-binding protein that co-localizes with bicoid mRNA is Staufen, which binds non-specifically to double-stranded RNA in vitro(6,7). Here we show that mutants in all subunits of the ESCRT-II complex (VPS22, VPS25 and VPS36) abolish the final Staufen-dependent step in bicoid mRNA localization. ESCRT-II is a highly conserved component of the pathway that sorts ubiquitinated endosomal proteins into internal vesicles(8,9), and functions as a tumour-suppressor by removing activated receptors from the cytoplasm(10,11). However, the role of ESCRT-II in bicoid localization seems to be independent of endosomal sorting, because mutations in ESCRT-I and III components do not affect the targeting of bicoid mRNA. Instead, VPS36 functions by binding directly and specifically to stem-loop V of the bicoid 39 UTR through its amino-terminal GLUE domain(12), making it the first example of a sequence-specific RNA-binding protein that recognizes the bicoid localization signal. Furthermore, VPS36 localizes to the anterior of the oocyte in a bicoid-mRNA-dependent manner, and is required for the subsequent recruitment of Staufen to the bicoid complex. This function of ESCRT-II as an RNA-binding complex is conserved in vertebrates and may clarify some of its roles that are independent of endosomal sorting.
