CD1-restricted T-cell responses and microbial infection
CD1, a conserved family of major histocompatibility (MHC)-like glycoproteins in mammals, specializes in capturing lipid rather than peptide antigen for presentation to T lymphocytes. The principles and mechanisms of this newly discovered immune strategy differ markedly from those governing classical MHC-peptide presentation. They might be exploited for the design of new lipid-based microbial vaccines and adjuvants.
