The process of tholin formation in Titan's upper atmosphere
Titan's lower atmosphere has long been known to harbor organic aerosols (tholins) presumed to have been formed from simple molecules, such as methane and nitrogen (CH4 and N-2). Up to now, it has been assumed that tholins were formed at altitudes of several hundred kilometers by processes as yet unobserved. Using measurements from a combination of mass/charge and energy/ charge spectrometers on the Cassini spacecraft, we have obtained evidence for tholin formation at high altitudes (similar to 1000 kilometers) in Titan's atmosphere. The observed chemical mix strongly implies a series of chemical reactions and physical processes that lead from simple molecules (CH4 and N-2) to larger, more complex molecules ( 80 to 350 daltons) to negatively charged massive molecules (similar to 8000 daltons), which we identify as tholins. That the process involves massive negatively charged molecules and aerosols is completely unexpected.
