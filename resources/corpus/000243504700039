High-temperature metal-organic magnets
For over two decades there have been intense efforts aimed at the development of alternatives to conventional magnets, particularly materials comprised in part or wholly of molecular components(1,2). Such alternatives offer the prospect of realizing magnets fabricated through controlled, low-temperature, solution-based chemistry, as opposed to high-temperature metallurgical routes, and also the possibility of tuning magnetic properties through synthesis. However, examples of magnetically ordered molecular materials at or near room temperature are extremely rare 3, and the properties of these materials are often capricious and difficult to reproduce. Here we present a versatile solution-based route to a new class of metal - organic materials exhibiting magnetic order well above room temperature. Reactions of the metal ( M) precursor complex bis(1,5-cyclooctadiene) nickel with three different organics A - TCNE ( tetracyanoethylene), TCNQ (7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane) or DDQ (2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone) - proceed via electron transfer from nickel to A and lead to materials containing Ni(II) ions and reduced forms of A in a 2: 1 Ni: A ratio - that is, opposite to that of conventional ( low Curie temperature) MA(2)-type magnets. These materials also contain oxygen-based species within their architectures. Magnetic characterization of the three compounds reveals spontaneous field-dependent magnetization and hysteresis at room temperature, with ordering temperatures well above ambient. The unusual stoichiometry and striking magnetic properties highlight these three compounds as members of a class of stable magnets that are at the interface between conventional inorganic magnets and genuine molecule-based magnets.
