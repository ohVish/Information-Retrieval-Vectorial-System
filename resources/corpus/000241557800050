A centrosome-independent role for gamma-TuRC proteins in the spindle assembly checkpoint
The spindle assembly checkpoint guards the fidelity of chromosome segregation. It requires the close cooperation of cell cycle regulatory proteins and cytoskeletal elements to sense spindle integrity. The role of the centrosome, the organizing center of the microtubule cytoskeleton, in the spindle checkpoint is unclear. We found that the molecular requirements for a functional spindle checkpoint included components of the large gamma-tubulin ring complex (gamma-TuRC). However, their localization at the centrosome and centrosome integrity were not essential for this function. Thus, the spindle checkpoint can be activated at the level of microtubule nucleation.
