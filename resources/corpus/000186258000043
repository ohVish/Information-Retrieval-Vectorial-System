Direct atom-resolved imaging of oxides and their grain boundaries
Using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, we obtained structure images of strontium titanate (SrTiO3) with a clearly resolved oxygen sublattice along different crystallographic directions in the bulk lattice and for a Sigma3 tilt grain boundary. Comparison with image simulations showed that the grain boundary contains oxygen vacancies. Measurements of atom displacements near the grain boundary revealed close correspondence with theoretical calculations.
