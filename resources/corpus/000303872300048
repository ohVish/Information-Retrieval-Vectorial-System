Ancient Maya Astronomical Tables from Xultun, Guatemala
Maya astronomical tables are recognized in bark-paper books from the Late Postclassic period (1300 to 1521 C. E.), but Classic period (200 to 900 C. E.) precursors have not been found. In 2011, a small painted room was excavated at the extensive ancient Maya ruins of Xultun, Guatemala, dating to the early 9th century C. E. The walls and ceiling of the room are painted with several human figures. Two walls also display a large number of delicate black, red, and incised hieroglyphs. Many of these hieroglyphs are calendrical in nature and relate astronomical computations, including at least two tables concerning the movement of the Moon, and perhaps Mars and Venus. These apparently represent early astronomical tables and may shed light on the later books.
