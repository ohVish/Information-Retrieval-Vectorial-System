Mechanism for the destruction of H-3(+) ions by electron impact
The rate at which the simplest triatomic ion (H-3(+)) dissociates following recombination with a low-energy electron has been measured in numerous experiments(1-10). This process is particularly important for understanding observations of H-3(+) in diffuse interstellar clouds(11-13). But, despite extensive efforts(14,15), no theoretical treatment has yet proved capable of predicting the measured dissociative recombination rates at low energy, even to within an order of magnitude. Here we show that the Jahn-Teller symmetry-distortion effect(16-19)-almost universally neglected in the theoretical description of electron-molecule collisions-generates recombination at a much faster rate than any other known mechanism. Our estimated rate constant overlaps the range of values spanned by experiments. We treat the low-energy collision process as a curve-crossing problem, which was previously thought inapplicable(20) to low-energy recombination in H-3(+). Our calculation reproduces the measured propensity for three-body versus two-body breakup of the neutral fragments(3), as well as the vibrational distribution(4) of the H-2 product molecules.
