Three-Color Entanglement
Entanglement is an essential quantum resource for the acceleration of information processing as well as for sophisticated quantum communication protocols. Quantum information networks are expected to convey information from one place to another by using entangled light beams. We demonstrated the generation of entanglement among three bright beams of light, all of different wavelengths (532.251, 1062.102, and 1066.915 nanometers). We also observed disentanglement for finite channel losses, the continuous variable counterpart to entanglement sudden death.
