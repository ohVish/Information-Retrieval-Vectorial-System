Nebulin and N-WASP Cooperate to Cause IGF-1-Induced Sarcomeric Actin Filament Formation
Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) induces skeletal muscle maturation and enlargement (hypertrophy). These responses require protein synthesis and myofibril formation (myofibrillogenesis). However, the signaling mechanisms of myofibrillogenesis remain obscure. We found that IGF-1-induced phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt signaling formed a complex of nebulin and N-WASP at the Z bands of myofibrils by interfering with glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta in mice. Although N-WASP is known to be an activator of the Arp2/3 complex to form branched actin filaments, the nebulin-N-WASP complex caused actin nucleation for unbranched actin filament formation from the Z bands without the Arp2/3 complex. Furthermore, N-WASP was required for IGF-1-induced muscle hypertrophy. These findings present the mechanisms of IGF-1-induced actin filament formation in myofibrillogenesis required for muscle maturation and hypertrophy and a mechanism of actin nucleation.
