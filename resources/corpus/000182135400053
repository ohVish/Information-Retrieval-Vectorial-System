C-14 dates from Tel Rehov: Iron-age chronology, pharaohs, and Hebrew kings
Stratified radiocarbon dates provide an independent chronological link between archaeological layers and historical data. The invasion by Pharaoh Shoshenq I (Shishak) is a key historical synchronism, similar to 925 B. C. E., mentioned in both Egyptian inscriptions and the Hebrew Bible. The list of places raided by Shoshenq, mentioned at Karnak ( Egypt), includes Rehov ( Israel). The site yielded a consistent series of radiocarbon dates from the 12th to 9th century B. C. E. Our results (i) suggest a revised Iron-Age chronology; (ii) date an archaeological stratum to Shoshenq's campaign; (iii) indicate the similarity of "Solomonic" and "Omride" pottery; and (iv) provide correlation with Greece and Cyprus.
