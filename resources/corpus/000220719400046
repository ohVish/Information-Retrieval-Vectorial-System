Tip20p prohibits back-fusion of COPII vesicles with the endoplasmic reticulum
Directionality in intracellular trafficking is essential to ensure the correct localization of proteins along the secretory pathway. Here, we found evidence for an active mechanism that prohibited back-fusion of de novo - generated vesicles with their donor compartment. Tip20p is a peripheral membrane protein implicated in consumption of COPI vesicles at the endoplasmic reticulum. However, a specific mutant of TIP20 did not interfere with COPII vesicle generation but allowed these vesicles to fuse back to the endoplasmic reticulum, a process that does not occur normally in the cell.
