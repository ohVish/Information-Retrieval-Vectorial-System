A model for neuronal competition during development
We report that developmental competition between sympathetic neurons for survival is critically dependent on a sensitization process initiated by target innervation and mediated by a series of feedback loops. Target- derived nerve growth factor ( NGF) promoted expression of its own receptor TrkA in mouse and rat neurons and prolonged TrkA- mediated signals. NGF also controlled expression of brain- derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin- 4, which, through the receptor p75, can kill neighboring neurons with low retrograde NGF- TrkA signaling whereas neurons with high NGF- TrkA signaling are protected. Perturbation of any of these feedback loops disrupts the dynamics of competition. We suggest that three target- initiated events are essential for rapid and robust competition between neurons: sensitization, paracrine apoptotic signaling, and protection from such effects.
