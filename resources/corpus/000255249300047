Human-induced arctic moistening
The Arctic and northern subpolar regions are critical for climate change. Ice- albedo feedback amplifies warming in the Arctic, and fluctuations of regional fresh water inflow to the Arctic Ocean modulate the deep ocean circulation and thus exert a strong global influence. By comparing observations to simulations from 22 coupled climate models, we find influence from anthropogenic greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosols in the space- time pattern of precipitation change over high-latitude land areas north of 55 degrees N during the second half of the 20th century. The human- induced Arctic moistening is consistent with observed increases in Arctic river discharge and freshening of Arctic water masses. This result provides new evidence that human activity has contributed to Arctic hydrological change.
