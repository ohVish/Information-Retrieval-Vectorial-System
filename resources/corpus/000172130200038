Signal transduction - The guanine nucleotide-binding switch in three dimensions
Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins regulate a variety of processes, including sensual perception, protein synthesis, various transport processes, and cell growth and differentiation. They act as molecular switches and timers that cycle between inactive guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-bound and active guanosine triphosphate (GTP)bound states. Recent structural studies show that the switch apparatus itself is a conserved fundamental module but that its regulators and effectors are quite diverse in their structures and modes of interaction. Here we will try to define some underlying principles.
