Export-mediated assembly of mycobacterial glycoproteins parallels eukaryotic pathways
Protein O-mannosylation is an essential and evolutionarily conserved post-translational modification among eukaryotes. This form of protein modification is also described in Mycobacterium tuberculosis; however, the mechanism of mannoprotein assembly remains unclear. Evaluation of differentially translocated chimeric proteins and mass spectrometry to monitor glycosylation demonstrated that specific translocation processes were required for protein O-mannosylation in M. tuberculosis. Additionally, Rv1002c, a M. tuberculosis membrane protein homolog of eukaryotic protein mannosyltransferases, was shown to catalyze the initial step of protein mannosylation. Thus, the-process of protein mannosylation is conserved between M. tuberculosis and eukaryotic organisms.
