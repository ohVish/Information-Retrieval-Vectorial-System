Computational prediction of small-molecule catalysts
Most organic and organometallic catalysts have been discovered through serendipity or trial and error, rather than by rational design. Computational methods, however, are rapidly becoming a versatile tool for understanding and predicting the roles of such catalysts in asymmetric reactions. Such methods should now be regarded as a first line of attack in the design of catalysts.
