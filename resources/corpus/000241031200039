Modeling single-neuron dynamics and computations: A balance of detail and abstraction
The fundamental building block of every nervous system is the single neuron. Understanding how these exquisitely structured elements operate is an integral part of the quest to solve the mysteries of the brain. Quantitative mathematical models have proved to be an indispensable tool in pursuing this goal. We review recent advances and examine how single-cell models on five levels of complexity, from black-box approaches to detailed compartmental simulations, address key questions about neural dynamics and signal processing.
