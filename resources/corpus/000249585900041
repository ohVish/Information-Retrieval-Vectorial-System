Universality classes for domain wall motion in the ferromagnetic semiconductor (Ga, Mn)As
Magnetic domain wall motion induced by magnetic fields and spin-polarized electrical currents is experimentally well established. A full understanding of the underlying mechanisms, however, remains elusive. For the ferromagnetic semiconductor (Ga, Mn)As, we have measured and compared such motions in the thermally activated subthreshold, or "creep," regime, where the velocity obeys an Arrhenius scaling law. Within this law, the clearly different exponents of the current and field reflect different universality classes, showing that the drive mechanisms are fundamentally different.
