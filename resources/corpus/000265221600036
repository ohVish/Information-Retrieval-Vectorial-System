A Ferroelectric Oxide Made Directly on Silicon
Metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors, formed using silicon dioxide and silicon, have undergone four decades of staggering technological advancement. With fundamental limits to this technology close at hand, alternatives to silicon dioxide are being pursued to enable new functionality and device architectures. We achieved ferroelectric functionality in intimate contact with silicon by growing coherently strained strontium titanate (SrTiO(3)) films via oxide molecular beam epitaxy in direct contact with silicon, with no interfacial silicon dioxide. We observed ferroelectricity in these ultrathin SrTiO(3) layers by means of piezoresponse force microscopy. Stable ferroelectric nanodomains created in SrTiO(3) were observed at temperatures as high as 400 kelvin.
