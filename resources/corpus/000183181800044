Modulation of phospholipid signaling by GLABRA2 in root-hair pattern formation
The root-hair pattern of Arabidopsis is determined through a regulatory circuit composed of transcription factor genes. The homeobox gene GLABRA2 (GL2) has been considered a key component, acting farthest downstream in this regulation. GL2 modified to include a transactivating function caused epidermal cells to develop ectopic root hairs or root hair-like structures. With this system, the phospholipase Dzeta1 gene (AtPLDzeta1) was identified as a direct target of GL2. Inducible expression of AtPLDzeta1 promoted ectopic root-hair initiation. We conclude that GL2 exerts its regulatory effect on root-hair development through modulation of phospholipid signaling.
