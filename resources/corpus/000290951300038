Inferring nonlinear mantle rheology from the shape of the Hawaiian swell
The convective circulation generated within the Earth's mantle by buoyancy forces of thermal and compositional origin is intimately controlled by the rheology of the rocks that compose it. These can deform either by the diffusion of point defects (diffusion creep, with a linear relationship between strain rate and stress) or by the movement of intracrystalline dislocations (nonlinear dislocation creep)(1,2). However, there is still no reliable map showing where in the mantle each of these mechanisms is dominant, and so it is important to identify regions where the operative mechanism can be inferred directly from surface geophysical observations. Here we identify a new observable quantity-the rate of downstream decay of the anomalous seafloor topography (swell) produced by a mantle plume-which depends only on the value of the exponent in the strain rate versus stress relationship that defines the difference between diffusion and dislocation creep. Comparison of the Hawaiian swell topography with the predictions of a simple fluid mechanical model shows that the swell shape is poorly explained by diffusion creep, and requires a dislocation creep rheology. The rheology predicted by the model is reasonably consistent with laboratory deformation data for both olivine(3) and clinopyroxene(4), suggesting that the source of Hawaiian lavas could contain either or both of these components.
