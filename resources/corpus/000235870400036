Giant electrocaloric effect in thin-film PbZr0.95Ti0.05O3
An applied electric field can reversibly change the temperature of an electrocaloric material under adiabatic conditions, and the effect is strongest near phase transitions. We demonstrate a giant electrocaloric effect (0.48 kelvin per volt) in 350-nanometer PbZr0.95Ti0.05O3 films near the ferroelectric Curie temperature of 222-degrees. A large electrocaloric effect may find application in electrical refrigeration.
