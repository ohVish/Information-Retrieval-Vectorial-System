Estimation of fault strength: Reconstruction of stress before the 1995 Kobe earthquake
We have estimated the stress field before the 1995 Kobe, Japan, earthquake (moment magnitude 6.9) using in situ post-shock stress measurements obtained from hydraulic fracturing experiments near the fault. We reconstructed the pre-shock stress field using a kinematic source model inverted from seismic waveforms and geodetic deformations. We found that at the center of the fault, two sides of the fault surface coupled completely before the earthquake, with a coefficient of friction of 0.6, which is equivalent to strong crust. At the edge of the fault, a possible aseismic slip is expected to occur from the pre-shock stress orientation.
