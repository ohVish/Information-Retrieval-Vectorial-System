Separation of long DNA molecules in a microfabricated entropic trap array
A nanofluidic channel device, consisting of many entropic traps, was designed and fabricated for the separation of Long DNA molecules. The channel comprises narrow constrictions and wider regions that cause size-dependent trapping of DNA at the onset of a constriction. This process creates electrophoretic mobility differences, thus enabling efficient separation without the use of a gel matrix or pulsed electric fields. Samples of Long DNA molecules (5000 to similar to 160,000 base pairs) were efficiently separated into bands in 15-millimeter-long channels. Multiple-channel devices operating in parallel were demonstrated. The efficiency, compactness, and ease of fabrication of the device suggest the possibility of more practical integrated DNA analysis systems.
