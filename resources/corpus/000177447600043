Photothermal imaging of nanometer-sized metal particles among scatterers
Ambient optical detection of labeled molecules is limited for fluorescent dyes by photobleaching and for semiconducting nanoparticles by blinking effects. Because nanometer-sized metal particles do not optically bleach, they may be useful optical labels if suitable detection signals can be found. We demonstrate far-field optical detection of gold colloids down to diameters of 2.5 nanometers with a photothermal method that combines high-frequency modulation and polarization interference contrast. The photothermal image is immune to the effects of scattering background, which limits particle imaging through Rayleigh scattering to diameters larger than 40 nanometers.
