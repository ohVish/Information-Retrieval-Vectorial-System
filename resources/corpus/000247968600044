Developmentally regulated activation of a SINE B2 repeat as a domain boundary in organogenesis
The temporal and spatial regulation of gene expression in mammalian development is linked to the establishment of functional chromatin domains. Here, we report that tissue-specific transcription of a retrotransposon repeat in the murine growth hormone locus is required for gene activation. This repeat serves as a boundary to block the influence of repressive chromatin modifications. The repeat element is able to generate short, overlapping Pol II- and Pol III-driven transcripts, both of which are necessary and sufficient to enable a restructuring of the regulated locus into nuclear compartments. These data suggest that transcription of interspersed repetitive sequences may represent a developmental strategy for the establishment of functionally distinct domains within the mammalian genome to control gene activation.
