Role of the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor EDG-1 in PDGF-induced cell motility
EDG-1 is a heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) for sphingosine-1-phosphate (SPP). Cell migration toward platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). which stimulates sphingosine kinase and increases intracellular SPP, was dependent on expression of EDG-1. Deletion of edg-1 or inhibition of sphingosine kinase suppressed chemotaxis toward PDGF and also activation of the small guanosine triphosphatase Rac, which is essential for protrusion of lamellipodia and forward movement. Moreover, PDGF activated EDG-1, as measured by translocation of beta -arrestin and phosphorylation of EDG-1. Our results reveal a role for receptor cross-communication in which activation of a GPCR by a receptor tyrosine kinase is critical for cell motility.
