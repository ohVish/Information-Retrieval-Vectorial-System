Fibulin-5/DANCE is essential for elastogenesis in vivo
The elastic fibre system has a principal role in the structure and function of various types of organs that require elasticity, such as large arteries, lung and skin(1,2). Although elastic fibres are known to be composed of microfibril proteins (for example, fibrillins and latent transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta -binding proteins) and polymerized elastin, the mechanism of their assembly and development is not well understood. Here we report that fibulin-5 (also known as DANCE), a recently discovered integrin ligand(3), is an essential determinant of elastic fibre organization. fibulin-5(-/-) mice generated by gene targeting exhibit a severely disorganized elastic fibre system throughout the body. fibulin-5(-/-) mice survive to adulthood, but have a tortuous aorta with loss of compliance, severe emphysema, and loose skin (cutis laxa). These tissues contain fragmented elastin without an increase of elastase activity, indicating defective development of elastic fibres. Fibulin-5 interacts directly with elastic fibres in vitro, and serves as a ligand for cell surface integrins alphav beta3, alphav beta5 and alpha9 beta1 through its aminoterminal domain. Thus, fibulin-5 may provide anchorage of elastic fibres to cells, thereby acting to stabilize and organize elastic fibres in the skin, lung and vasculature.
