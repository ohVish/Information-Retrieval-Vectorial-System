Transmembrane phosphoprotein Cbp regulates the activities of Src-family tyrosine kinases
The Src family of protein tyrosine kinases (Src-PTKs) is important in the regulation of growth and differentiation of eukaryotic cells. The activity of Src-PTKs in cells of different types is negatively controlled by Csk, which specifically phosphorylates a conserved regulatory tyrosine residue at the carboxy-terminal tail of the Src-PTKs(1-3). Csk is mainly cytoplasmic and Src-PTKs are predominantly membrane-associated. This raises a question about the mechanism of interaction between these enzymes. Here we present Cbp-a transmembrane phosphoprotein that is ubiquitously expressed and binds specifically to the SH2 domain of Csk. Cbp is involved in the membrane localization of Csk and in the Csk-mediated inhibition of c-Src. In the plasma membrane Cbp is exclusively localized in the GM1 ganglioside-enriched detergent-insoluble membrane domain, which is important in receptor-mediated signalling(4-8). These findings reveal Cbp as a new component of the regulatory mechanism controlling the activity of membrane-associated Src-PTKs.
