Divided by cytochrome oxidase: A map of the projections from V1 to V2 in Macaques
Current models partition the primate visual system into dorsal (magno) and ventral (parvo, konio) streams. Perhaps the strongest evidence for this idea has come from the pattern of projections between the primary visual area (V1) and the second visual area (V2). Prior studies describe three distinct pathways: magno to thick stripes, parvo to pate stripes, and konio to thin stripes. We now demonstrate that V1 output arises from just two sources: patch columns and interpatch columns. Patch columns project to thin stripes and interpatch columns project to pate and thick stripes. Projection of interpatches to common V2-stripe types (pate and thick) merges parvo and magno inputs, making it likely that these functional channels are distributed strongly to both dorsal and ventral streams.
