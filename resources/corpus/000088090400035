fw2.2: A quantitative trait locus key to the evolution of tomato fruit size
Domestication of many plants has correlated with dramatic increases in fruit size. In tomato, one quantitative trait Locus (QTL), fw2.2, was responsible for a Large step in this process. When transformed into large-fruited cultivars, a cosmid derived from the fw2.2 region of a small-fruited wild species reduced fruit size by the predicted amount and had the gene action expected for fw2.2. The cause of the QTL effect is a single gene, ORFX, that is expressed early in floral development, controls carpel cell number, and has a sequence suggesting structural similarity to the human oncogene c-H-ras p21. Alterations in fruit size, imparted by fw2.2 alleles, are most Likely due to changes in regulation rather than in the sequence and structure of the encoded protein.
