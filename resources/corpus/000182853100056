Control of osteoblast function and regulation of bone mass
The skeleton is an efficient 'servo' (feedback-controlled/steady-state) system that continuously integrates signals and responses which sustain its functions of delivering calcium while maintaining strength. In many individuals, bone mass homeostasis starts failing in midlife, leading to bone loss, osteoporosis and debilitating fractures. Recent advances, spearheaded by genetic information, offer the opportunity to stop or reverse this downhill course.
