Pharmacogenetics and the practice of medicine
"If it were not for the great variability among individuals medicine might as well be a science and not an art." The thoughts of Sir William Osler in 1892 reflect the view of medicine over the past 100 years. The role of physicians in making the necessary judgements about the medicines that they prescribe is often referred to as an art, reflecting the lack of objective data available to make decisions that are tailored to individual patients. Just over a hundred years later we are on the verge of being able to identify inherited differences between individuals which can predict each patient's response to a medicine. This ability will have far-reaching benefits in the discovery, development and delivery of medicines. Sir William Osler, if he were alive today, would be re-considering his view of medicine as an art not a science.
