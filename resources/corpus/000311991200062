Self-Terminating Growth of Platinum Films by Electrochemical Deposition
A self-terminating rapid electrodeposition process for controlled growth of platinum (Pt) monolayer films from a K2PtCl4-NaCl electrolyte has been developed that is tantamount to wet atomic layer deposition. Despite the deposition overpotential being in excess of 1 volt, Pt deposition was quenched at potentials just negative of proton reduction by an alteration of the double-layer structure induced by a saturated surface coverage of underpotential deposited H (H-upd). The surface was reactivated for further Pt deposition by stepping the potential to more positive values, where H-upd is oxidized and fresh sites for the adsorption of PtCl42- become available. Periodic pulsing of the potential enables sequential deposition of two-dimensional Pt layers to fabricate films of desired thickness, relevant to a range of advanced technologies.
