SUB1, an Arabidopsis Ca2+-binding protein involved in cryptochrome and phytochrome coaction
Cryptochromes and phytochromes are the major photosensory receptors in plants and often regulate similar photomorphogenic responses. The molecular mechanisms underlying functional interactions of cryptochromes and phytochromes remain Largely unclear. We have identified an Arabidopsis photomorphogenic mutant, sub1, which exhibits hypersensitive responses to blue light and far-red Light. Genetic analyses indicate that SUB1 functions as a component of a cryptochrome signaling pathway and as a modulator of a phytochrome signaling pathway. The SUB1 gene encodes a Ca2+-binding protein that suppresses Light-dependent accumulation of the transcription factor HY5.
