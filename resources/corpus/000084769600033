Reaction of plutonium dioxide with water: Formation and properties of PuO2+x
Results show that PuO2-x, a high-composition (x less than or equal to 0.27) phase containing Pu(VI), is the stable binary oxide in air, This nonstoichiometric oxide forms by reaction of dioxide with water and by water-catalyzed reaction of dioxide with oxygen. The PuO2 + H2O reaction rate is 0.27 nanomoles per meter squared per hour at 25 degrees C; the activation energy at 25 degrees to 350 degrees C is 39 kilojoules per mole. Slow kinetics and a Low Lattice parameter-composition dependence for fluorite-related PuO2+x are consistent with a failure to observe the phase in earlier studies. Perplexing aspects of plutonium oxide chemistry can now be explained.
