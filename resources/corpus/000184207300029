Circadian clocks in daily and seasonal control of development
The rotation of the earth results in regular changes in the light environment, and organisms have evolved a molecular oscillator that allows them to anticipate these changes. This daily molecular oscillator, known as the circadian clock, regulates a diverse array of physiologies across a wide variety of organisms. This review highlights a few of the insights we have into circadian clock regulation of development, in both plants and animals. A common thread linking plants and animals is the use of the circadian clock to sense changes in day length and to mediate a diverse number of photoperiodic responses.
