Transcription - Signal transduction and the control of gene expression
More than 2000 transcription factors are encoded in the human genome. Such proteins have often been classified according to common structural elements. But because transcription factors evolved in the service of biologic function, we propose an alternative grouping of eukaryotic transcription factors on the basis of characteristics that describe their roles within cellular regulatory circuits.
