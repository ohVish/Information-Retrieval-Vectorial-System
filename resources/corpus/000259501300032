Synthesis and solid-state NMR structural characterization of (13)C-labeled graphite oxide
The detailed chemical structure of graphite oxide ( GO), a layered material prepared from graphite almost 150 years ago and a precursor to chemically modified graphenes, has not been previously resolved because of the pseudo- random chemical functionalization of each layer, as well as variations in exact composition. Carbon-13 ((13)C) solid- state nuclear magnetic resonance ( SSNMR) spectra of GO for natural abundance (13)C have poor signal- to- noise ratios. Approximately 100% (13)C- labeled graphite was made and converted to (13)C- labeled GO, and (13)C SSNMR was used to reveal details of the chemical bonding network, including the chemical groups and their connections. Carbon-13-labeled graphite can be used to prepare chemically modified graphenes for (13)C SSNMR analysis with enhanced sensitivity and for fundamental studies of (13)C-labeled graphite and graphene.
