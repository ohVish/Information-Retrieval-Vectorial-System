Unique chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation in spermatogenesis
Most of our knowledge of transcriptional regulation comes from studies in somatic cells. However, increasing evidence reveals that gene regulation mechanisms are different in haploid germ cells. A number of highly specialized strategies operate during spermatogenesis. These include a unique chromatin reorganization program and the use of distinct promoter elements and specific transcription factors. Deciphering the rules governing transcriptional control during spermatogenesis will provide valuable insights of biomedical importance.
