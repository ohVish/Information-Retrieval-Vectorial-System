Raney Ni-Sn catalyst for H-2 production from biomass-derived hydrocarbons
Hydrogen (H-2) was produced by aqueous-phase reforming of biomass-derived oxygenated hydrocarbons at temperatures near 500 kelvin over a tin-promoted Raney-nickel catalyst. The performance of this non - precious metal catalyst compares favorably with that of platinum-based catalysts for production of hydrogen from ethylene glycol, glycerol, and sorbitol. The addition of tin to nickel decreases the rate of methane formation from C-O bond cleavage while maintaining the high rates of C-C bond cleavage required for hydrogen formation.
