A mammalian H+ channel generated through alternative splicing of the NADPH oxidase homolog NOH-1
Voltage-gated proton (H+) channels are found in many human and animal tissues and play an important role in cellular defense against acidic stress. However, a molecular identification of these unique ion conductances has so far not been achieved. A 191-amino acid protein is described that, upon heterologous expression, has properties indistinguishable from those of native H+ channels. This protein is generated through alternative splicing of messenger RNA derived from the gene NOH-1 (NADPH oxidase homolog 1, where NADPH is the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate).
