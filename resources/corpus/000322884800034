A Semi-Floating Gate Transistor for Low-Voltage Ultrafast Memory and Sensing Operation
As the semiconductor devices of integrated circuits approach the physical limitations of scaling, alternative transistor and memory designs are needed to achieve improvements in speed, density, and power consumption. We report on a transistor that uses an embedded tunneling field-effect transistor for charging and discharging the semi-floating gate. This transistor operates at low voltages (<= 2.0 volts), with a large threshold voltage window of 3.1 volts, and can achieve ultra-high-speed writing operations (on time scales of similar to 1 nanosecond). A linear dependence of drain current on light intensity was observed when the transistor was exposed to light, so possible applications include image sensing with high density and performance.
