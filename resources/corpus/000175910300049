An LRR receptor kinase involved in perception of a peptide plant hormone, phytosulfokine
The sulfated peptide phytosulfokine (PSK) is an intercellular signal that plays a key role in cellular dedifferentiation and proliferation in plants. Using ligand-based affinity chromatography, we purified a 120-kilodalton membrane protein, specifically interacting with PSK, from carrot microsomal fractions. The corresponding complementary DNA encodes a 1021-amino acid receptor kinase that contains extracellular leucine-rich repeats, a single transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic kinase domain. Overexpression of this receptor kinase in carrot cells caused enhanced callus growth in response to PSK and a substantial increase in the number of tritium-labeled PSK binding sites, suggesting that PSK and this receptor kinase act as a ligand-receptor pair.
