Role of T-bet in commitment of T(H)1 cells before IL-12-dependent selection
How cytokines control differentiation of helper T (T-H) cells is controversial. We show that T-bet, without apparent assistance from interleukin 12 (IL-12)/ STAT4, specifies T(H)1 effector fate by targeting chromatin remodeling to individual interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) alleles and by inducing IL-12 receptor beta2 expression. Subsequently, it appears that IL-12/STAT4 serves two essential functions in the development of T(H)1 cells: as growth signal, inducing survival and cell division; and as trans-activator, prolonging IFN-gamma synthesis through a genetic interaction with the coactivator, CREB-binding protein. These results suggest that a cytokine does not simply induce T-H fate choice but instead may act as an essential secondary stimulus that mediates selective survival of a lineage.
