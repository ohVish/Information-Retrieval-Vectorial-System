Mitochondrial remnant organelles of Giardia function in iron-sulphur protein maturation
Giardia intestinalis (syn. lamblia) is one of the most widespread intestinal protozoan pathogens worldwide, causing hundreds of thousands of cases of diarrhoea each year(1). Giardia is a member of the diplomonads, often described as an ancient protist group whose primitive nature is suggested by the lack of typical eukaryotic organelles (for example, mitochondria, peroxisomes), the presence of a poorly developed endomembrane system and by their early branching in a number of gene phylogenies(1,2). The discovery of nuclear genes of putative mitochondrial ancestry in Giardia(3-7) and the recent identification of mitochondrial remnant organelles in amitochondrial protists such as Entamoeba histolytica(8,9) and Trachipleistophora hominis(10) suggest that the eukaryotic amitochondrial state is not a primitive condition but is rather the result of reductive evolution. Using an in vitro protein reconstitution assay and specific antibodies against IscS and IscU-two mitochondrial marker proteins involved in iron sulphur cluster biosynthesis-here we demonstrate that Giardia contains mitochondrial remnant organelles (mitosomes) bounded by double membranes that function in iron-sulphur protein maturation. Our results indicate that Giardia is not primitively amitochondrial and that it has retained a functional organelle derived from the original mitochondrial endosymbiont.
