Earthquake Supercycles Inferred from Sea-Level Changes Recorded in the Corals of West Sumatra
Records of relative sea- level change extracted from corals of the Mentawai islands, Sumatra, imply that this 700- kilometer- long section of the Sunda megathrust has generated broadly similar sequences of great earthquakes about every two centuries for at least the past 700 years. The moment magnitude 8.4 earthquake of September 2007 represents the first in a series of large partial failures of the Mentawai section that will probably be completed within the next several decades.
