Magnifying superlens in the visible frequency range
We demonstrate a magnifying superlens that can be integrated into a conventional far-field optical microscope. Our design is based on a multilayer photonic metamaterial consisting of alternating layers of positive and negative refractive index, as originally proposed by Narimanov and Engheta. We achieved a resolution on the order of 70 nanometers. The use of such a magnifying superlens should find numerous applications in imaging.
