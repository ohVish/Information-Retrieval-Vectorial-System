Requirement of a macromolecular signaling complex for beta adrenergic receptor modulation of the KCNQ1-KCNE1 potassium channel
Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) regulation of cardiac action potential duration (APD) is mediated by beta adrenergic receptor (betaAR) activation, which increases the stow outward potassium ion current (I-Ks). Mutations in two human I-Ks channel subunits, hKCNQ1 and hKCNE1, prolong APD and cause inherited cardiac arrhythmias known as LQTS (long QT syndrome). We show that PAR modulation of I-Ks requires targeting of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP)dependent protein kinase (PKA) and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) to hKCNQ1 through the targeting protein yotiao. Yotiao binds to hKCNQ1 by a leucine zipper motif, which is disrupted by an LQTS mutation (hKCNQ1-G589D). Identification of the hKCNQ1 macromolecular complex provides a mechanism for SNS modulation of cardiac APD through I-Ks.
