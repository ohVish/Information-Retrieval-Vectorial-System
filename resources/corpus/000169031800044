Sorting of mannose 6-phosphate receptors mediated by the GGAs
The delivery of soluble hydrolases to lysosomes is mediated by the cation-independent and cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptors. The cytosolic tails of both receptors contain acidic-cluster-dileucine signals that direct sorting from the trans-Golgi network to the endosomal-lysosomal system. We found that these signals bind to the VHS domain of the Golgi-localized, gamma -ear-containing, ARF-binding proteins (GGAs). The receptors and the GGAs left the trans-Golgi network on the same tubulo-vesicular carriers. A dominant-negative GGA mutant blocked exit of the receptors from the trans-Golgi, network. Thus, the GGAs appear to mediate sorting of the mannose 6-phosphate receptors at the trans-Golgi network.
