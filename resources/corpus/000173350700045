The vibrational spectrum of H2O3
This report presents positive infrared spectroscopic identification of H2O3, a higher oxide of hydrogen of importance for the understanding of the chain formation ability of atomic oxygen and a possible intermediate in hydrogen oxygen radical chemistry. All fundamental vibrations of H2O3, isolated in an argon matrix, have been observed. In addition, several bands of HDO3, D2O3, and H-2 O-16(2) O-18 have been measured. One particular mode, the antisymetric O-O stretch at 776 cm(-1), should be observable even in the presence of high water concentrations.
