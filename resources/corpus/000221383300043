Preference for vibrational over translational energy in a gas-surface reaction
State-resolved gas-surface reactivity measurements revealed that vibrational excitation of nu(3) (the antisymmetric C-H stretch) activates methane dissociation more efficiently than does translational energy. Methane molecules in the vibrational ground state require 45 kilojoules per mole (kJ/mol) of translational energy to attain the same reactivity enhancement provided by 36 kJ/mol of nu(3) excitation. This result contradicts a key assumption underlying statistical theories of gas-surface reactivity and provides direct experimental evidence of the central role that vibrational energy can play in activating gas-surface reactions.
