Self-assembly of subnanometer-diameter single-wall MoS2 nanotubes
We report on the synthesis, structure, and self-assembly of single-wall subnanometer-diameter molybdenum disulfide tubes, The nanotubes are up to hundreds of micrometers Long and display diverse self-assembly properties on different Length scales, ranging from twisted bundles to regularly shaped "furry" forms. The bundles, which contain interstitial iodine, can be readily disassembled into individual 'molybdenum disulfide nanotubes. The synthesis was performed using a novel type of catalyzed transport reaction including C-60 as a growth promoter.
