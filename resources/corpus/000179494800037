Guest-dependent spin crossover in a nanoporous molecular framework material
The nanoporous metal-organic framework Fe-2(azpy)(4)(NCS)(4).(guest) (azpy is trans-4,4'-azopyridine) displays reversible uptake and release of guest molecules and contains electronic switching centers that are sensitive to the nature of the sorbed guests. The switching of this material arises from the presence of iron(II) spin crossover centers within the framework lattice, the sorbed phases undergoing "half-spin" crossovers, and the desorbed phase showing no switching property. The interpenetrated framework structure displays a considerable flexibility with guest uptake and release, causing substantial changes in the local geometry of the iron(II) centers. The generation of a host lattice that interacts with exchangeable guest species in a switchable fashion has implications for the generation of previously undeveloped advanced materials with applications in areas such as molecular sensing.
