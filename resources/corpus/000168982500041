Many-body and correlation effects in semiconductors
Solids consist of 10(22)-10(23) particles per cubic centimetre, interacting through infinite-range Coulomb interactions. The linear response of a solid to a weak external perturbation is well described by the concept of non-interacting 'quasiparticles' first introduced by Landau. But interactions between quasiparticles can be substantial in dense systems. For example, studies over the past decade have shown that Coulomb correlations between quasiparticles dominate the nonlinear optical response of semiconductors, in marked contrast to the behaviour of atomic systems. These Coulomb correlations and other many-body interactions are important not only for semiconductors, but also for all condensed-matter systems.
