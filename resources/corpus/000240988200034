From in vivo to in silico biology and back
The massive acquisition of data in molecular and cellular biology has led to the renaissance of an old topic: simulations of biological systems. Simulations, increasingly paired with experiments, are being successfully and routinely used by computational biologists to understand and predict the quantitative behaviour of complex systems, and to drive new experiments. Nevertheless, many experimentalists still consider simulations an esoteric discipline only for initiates. Suspicion towards simulations should dissipate as the limitations and advantages of their application are better appreciated, opening the door to their permanent adoption in everyday research.
