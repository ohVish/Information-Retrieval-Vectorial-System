Curtain eruptions from Enceladus' south-polar terrain
Observations of the south pole of the Saturnian moon Enceladus revealed large rifts in the south-polar terrain, informally called 'tiger stripes', named Alexandria, Baghdad, Cairo and Damascus Sulci. These fractures have been shown to be the sources of the observed jets of water vapour and icy particles(1-4) and to exhibit higher temperatures than the surrounding terrain(5,6). Subsequent observations have focused on obtaining close-up imaging of this region to better characterize these emissions. Recent work(7) examined those newer data sets and used triangulation of discrete jets3 to produce maps of jetting activity at various times. Here we show that much of the eruptive activity can be explained by broad, curtain-like eruptions. Optical illusions in the curtain eruptions resulting from a combination of viewing direction and local fracture geometry produce image features that were probably misinterpreted previously as discrete jets. We present maps of the total emission along the fractures, rather than just the jet-like component, for five times during an approximately one-year period in 2009 and 2010. An accurate picture of the style, timing and spatial distribution of the south-polar eruptions is crucial to evaluating theories for the mec(h)anism controlling the eruptions.
