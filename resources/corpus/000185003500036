Measurement of single-molecule resistance by repeated formation of molecular junctions
The conductance of a single molecule connected to two gold electrodes was determined by repeatedly forming thousands of gold-molecule-gold junctions. Conductance histograms revealed well-defined peaks at integer multiples of a fundamental conductance value, which was used to identify the conductance of a single molecule. The resistances near zero bias were 10.5+/-0.5, 51+/-5, 630+/-50, and 1.3+/-0.1 megohms for hexanedithiol, octanedithiol, decanedithiol, and 4,4' bipyridine, respectively. The tunneling decay constant (beta(N)) for N-alkanedithiols was 1.0+/-0.1 per carbon atom and was weakly dependent on the applied bias. The resistance and beta(N) values are consistent with first-principles calculations.
