Synthesis of zeolite as ordered multicrystal arrays
Zeolites are crystalline nanoporous aluminosilicates widely used in industry. In order for zeolites to find applications as innovative materials, they need to be organized into large two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) arrays. We report that uniformly aligned polyurethane films can serve as templates for the synthesis of uniformly aligned 2D and possibly 3D arrays of silicalite-1 crystals, in which the orientations of the crystals are controlled by the nature of the polymers. We propose that the supramolecularly organized organic-inorganic composites that consist of the hydrolyzed organic products and the seed crystals are responsible for this phenomenon.
