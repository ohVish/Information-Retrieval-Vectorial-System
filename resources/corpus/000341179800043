Intense foreshocks and a slow slip event preceded the 2014 Iquique M-w 8.1 earthquake
The subduction zone in northern Chile is a well-identified seismic gap that last ruptured in 1877. The moment magnitude (M-w) 8.1 Iquique earthquake of 1 April 2014 broke a highly coupled portion of this gap. To understand the seismicity preceding this event, we studied the location and mechanisms of the foreshocks and computed Global Positioning System (GPS) time series at stations located on shore. Seismicity off the coast of Iquique started to increase in January 2014. After 16 March, several M-w > 6 events occurred near the low-coupled zone. These events migrated northward for similar to 50 kilometers until the 1 April earthquake occurred. On 16 March, on-shore continuous GPS stations detected a westward motion that we model as a slow slip event situated in the same area where the mainshock occurred.
