Evidence for nuclear emissions during acoustic cavitation
In cavitation experiments with deuterated acetone, tritium decay activity above background levels was detected. In addition, evidence for neutron emission near 2.5 million electron volts was also observed, as would be expected for deuterium-deuterium fusion. Control experiments with normal acetone did not result in tritium activity or neutron emissions. Hydrodynamic shock code simulations supported the observed data and indicated highly compressed, hot (10(6) to 10(7) kelvin) bubble implosion conditions, as required for nuclear fusion reactions.
