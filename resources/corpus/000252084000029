Reduced North Atlantic Deep Water coeval with the glacial Lake Agassiz freshwater outburst
An outstanding climate anomaly 8200 years before the present ( B. P.) in the North Atlantic is commonly postulated to be the result of weakened overturning circulation triggered by a freshwater outburst. New stable isotopic and sedimentological records from a northwest Atlantic sediment core reveal that the most prominent Holocene anomaly in bottom- water chemistry and flow speed in the deep limb of the Atlantic overturning circulation begins at similar to 8.38 thousand years B. P., coeval with the catastrophic drainage of Lake Agassiz. The influence of Lower North Atlantic Deep Water was strongly reduced at our site for similar to 100 years after the outburst, confirming the ocean's sensitivity to freshwater forcing. The similarities between the timing and duration of the pronounced deep circulation changes and regional climate anomalies support a causal link.
