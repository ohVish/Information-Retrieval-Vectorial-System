The enigma of supersolidity
A 'supersolid' is a quantum solid in which a fraction of the mass is superfluid. As a remarkable consequence, it is rigid, but part of its mass is able to flow owing to quantum physical processes. This paradoxical state of matter was considered as a theoretical possibility as early as 1969, but its existence was discovered only in 2004, in He-4. Since then, intense experimental and theoretical efforts have been made to explain the origins of this exotic state of matter. It now seems that its physical interpretation is more complicated than originally thought.
