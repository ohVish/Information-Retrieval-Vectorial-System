m(6)A mRNA methylation facilitates resolution of naive pluripotency toward differentiation
Naive and primed pluripotent states retain distinct molecular properties, yet limited knowledge exists on how their state transitions are regulated. Here, we identify Mettl3, an N-6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) transferase, as a regulator for terminating murine naive pluripotency. Mettl3 knockout preimplantation epiblasts and naive embryonic stem cells are depleted for m(6)A in mRNAs, yet are viable. However, they fail to adequately terminate their naive state and, subsequently, undergo aberrant and restricted lineage priming at the postimplantation stage, which leads to early embryonic lethality. m(6)A predominantly and directly reduces mRNA stability, including that of key naive pluripotency-promoting transcripts. This study highlights a critical role for an mRNA epigenetic modification in vivo and identifies regulatory modules that functionally influence naive and primed pluripotency in an opposing manner.
