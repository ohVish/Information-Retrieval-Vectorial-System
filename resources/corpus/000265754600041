Discrete sources as the origin of the Galactic X-ray ridge emission
An unresolved X-ray glow (at energies above a few kiloelectron-volts) was discovered about 25 years ago and found to be coincident with the Galactic disk-the Galactic ridge X-ray emission(1,2). This emission(3-10) has a spectrum characteristic of a similar to 10(8) K optically thin thermal plasma, with a prominent iron emission line at 6.7 keV. The gravitational well of the Galactic disk, however, is far too shallow to confine such a hot interstellar medium; instead, it would flow away at a velocity of a few thousand kilometres per second, exceeding the speed of sound in the gas. To replenish the energy losses requires a source of 10(43) erg s(-1), exceeding by orders of magnitude all plausible energy sources in the Milky Way(11). An alternative is that the hot plasma is bound to a multitude of faint sources(12), which is supported by the recently observed similarities in the X-ray and near-infrared surface brightness distributions(13,14) (the latter traces the Galactic stellar distribution). Here we report that at energies of similar to 6-7 keV, more than 80 per cent of the seemingly diffuse X-ray emission is resolved into discrete sources, probably accreting white dwarfs and coronally active stars.
