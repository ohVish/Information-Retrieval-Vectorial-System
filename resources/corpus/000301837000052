Long-Range-Projecting GABAergic Neurons Modulate Inhibition in Hippocampus and Entorhinal Cortex
The hippocampus and entorhinal cortex play a pivotal role in spatial learning and memory. The two forebrain regions are highly interconnected via excitatory pathways. Using optogenetic tools, we identified and characterized long-range gamma-aminobutyric acid-releasing (GABAergic) neurons that provide a bidirectional hippocampal-entorhinal inhibitory connectivity and preferentially target GABAergic interneurons. Activation of long-range GABAergic axons enhances sub- and suprathreshold rhythmic theta activity of postsynaptic neurons in the target areas.
