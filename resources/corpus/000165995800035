Element-selective single atom imaging
Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) is widely used to identify elemental compositions of materials studied by microscopy. We demonstrate that the sensitivity and spatial resolution of EELS can be extended to the single-atom Limit. A chemical map for gadolinium (Cd) clearly reveals the distribution of Cd atoms inside a single chain of metallofullerene molecules (Gd@C-82) generated within a single-wall carbon nanotube, This characterization technique thus provides the "eyes" to see and identify individual atoms in nanostructures. It is likely to find broad application in nanoscale science and technology research.
