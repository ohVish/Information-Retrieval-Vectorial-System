A bacterial cell-cycle regulatory network operating in time and space
Transcriptional regulatory circuits provide only a fraction of the signaling pathways and regulatory mechanisms that control the bacterial cell cycle. The CtrA regulatory network, important in control of the Caulobacter cell cycle, illustrates the critical role of nontranscriptional pathways and temporally and spatially localized regulatory proteins. The system architecture of Caulobacter cell-cycle control involves top-down control of modular functions by a small number of master regulatory proteins with cross-module signaling coordinating the overall process. Modeling the cell cycle probably requires a top-down modeling approach and a hybrid control system modeling paradigm to treat its combined discrete and continuous characteristics.
