A high-resolution map of human chromosome 12
Our sequence-tagged site-content map of chromosome 12 is now integrated with the whole-genome fingerprinting effort(1,2). It provides accurate and nearly complete bacterial clone coverage of chromosome 12. We propose that this integrated mapping protocol serves as a model for constructing physical maps for entire genomes.
