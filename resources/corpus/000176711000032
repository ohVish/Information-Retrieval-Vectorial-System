Probing and controlling the bonds of an artificial molecule
We demonstrate how molecular quantum states of coupled semiconductor quantum dots are coherently probed and manipulated in transport experiments. The applied method probes quantum states by the virtual cotunneling of two electrons and hence resolves the sequences of molecular states simultaneously. This result is achieved by weakly probing the quantum system through parallel contacts to its constituting quantum dots. The overlap of the dots wave functions and, in turn, the splitting of molecular states are adjusted by the direct influence of coupling electrodes.
