Synthesis of biaryls via catalytic decarboxylative coupling
We present a safe and convenient cross-coupling strategy for the large-scale synthesis of biaryls, commercially important structures often found in biologically active molecules. In contrast to traditional cross-couplings, which require the prior preparation of organometallic reagents, we use a copper catalyst to generate the carbon nucleophiles in situ, via decarboxylation of easily accessible arylcarboxylic acid salts. The scope and potential economic impact of the reaction are demonstrated by the synthesis of 26 biaryls, one of which is an intermediate in the large-scale production of the agricultural fungicide Boscalid.
