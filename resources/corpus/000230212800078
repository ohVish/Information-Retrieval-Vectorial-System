tRNA actively shuttles between the nucleus and cytosol in yeast
Previous evidence suggested that transfer RNAs (tRNAs) cross the nuclear envelope to the cytosol only once after maturing in the nucleus. We now present evidence for nuclear import of tRNAs in yeast. Several export mutants accumulate mature tRNAs in the nucleus even in the absence of transcription. Import requires energy but not the Ran cycle. These results indicate that tRNAs shuttle between the nucleus and cytosol.
