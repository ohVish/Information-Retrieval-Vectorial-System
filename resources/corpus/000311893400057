HIV therapy by a combination of broadly neutralizing antibodies in humanized mice
Human antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) can neutralize a broad range of viral isolates in vitro and protect non-human primates against infection(1,2). Previous work showed that antibodies exert selective pressure on the virus but escape variants emerge within a short period of time(3,4). However, these experiments were performed before the recent discovery of more potent anti-HIV-1 antibodies and their improvement by structure-based design(5-9). Here we re-examine passive antibody transfer as a therapeutic modality in HIV-1-infected humanized mice. Although HIV-1 can escape from antibody monotherapy, combinations of broadly neutralizing antibodies can effectively control HIV-1 infection and suppress viral load to levels below detection. Moreover, in contrast to antiretroviral therapy(10-12), the longer half-life of antibodies led to control of viraemia for an average of 60 days after cessation of therapy. Thus, combinations of potent monoclonal antibodies can effectively control HIV-1 replication in humanized mice, and should be re-examined as a therapeutic modality in HIV-1-infected individuals.
