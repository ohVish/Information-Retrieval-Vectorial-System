An atomic seesaw switch formed by tilted asymmetric Sn-Ge dimers on a Ge (001) surface
When tin (Sn) atoms are deposited on a clean germanium (Ge) (001) surface at room temperature, buckled dimers originating from the Sn atoms are formed at the Ge-dimer position. We identified the dimer as a heterogeneous Sn-Ge dimer by reversing its buckling orientation with a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) at 80 kelvin. An atomic seesaw switch was formed for one-dimensional electronic conduction in the Ge dimer-row direction by using the STM to reversibly flip the buckling orientation of the Sn-Ge dimer and to set up standing-wave states.
