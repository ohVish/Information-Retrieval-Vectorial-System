Quasicrystalline structure formation in a classical crystalline thin-film system
The discovery of quasicrystals(1)-crystalline structures that show order while lacking periodicity-forced a paradigm shift in crystallography. Initially limited to intermetallic systems(1-4), the observation of quasicrystalline structures has recently expanded to include 'soft' quasicrystals in the fields of colloidal and supermolecular chemistry(5-9). Here we report an aperiodic oxide that grows as a two-dimensional quasicrystal on a periodic single-element substrate. On a Pt(111) substrate with 3-fold symmetry, the perovskite barium titanate BaTiO3 forms a high-temperature interface-driven structure with 12-fold symmetry. The building blocks of this dodecagonal structure assemble with the theoretically predicted Stampfli-Gahler tiling(10,11) having a fundamental length-scale of 0.69 nm. This example of interface-driven formation of ultrathin quasicrystals from a typical periodic perovskite oxide potentially extends the quasicrystal concept to a broader range of materials. In addition, it demonstrates that frustration at the interface between two periodic materials can drive a thin film into an aperiodic quasicrystalline phase, as proposed previously(12). Such structures might also find use as ultrathin buffer layers for the accommodation of large lattice mismatches in conventional epitaxy(13).
