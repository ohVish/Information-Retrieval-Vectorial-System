Puzzles, promises and a cure for ageing
Recent discoveries in the science of ageing indicate that lifespan in model organisms such as yeast, nematodes, flies and mice is plastic and can be manipulated by genetic, nutritional or pharmacological intervention. A better understanding of the targets of such interventions, as well as the proximate causes of ageing-related degeneration and disease, is essential before we can evaluate if abrogation of human senescence is a realistic prospect.
