Sudden Death of Entanglement
A new development in the dynamical behavior of elementary quantum systems is the surprising discovery that correlation between two quantum units of information called qubits can be degraded by environmental noise in a way not seen previously in studies of dissipation. This new route for dissipation attacks quantum entanglement, the essential resource for quantum information as well as the central feature in the Einstein- Podolsky- Rosen so- called paradox and in discussions of the fate of Schrodinger's cat. The effect has been labeled ESD, which stands for early- stage disentanglement or, more frequently, entanglement sudden death. We review recent progress in studies focused on this phenomenon.
