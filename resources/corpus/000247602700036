Engineering complex dynamical structures: Sequential patterns and desynchronization
We used phase models to describe and tune complex dynamic structures to desired states; weak, nondestructive signals are used to alter interactions among nonlinear rhythmic elements. Experiments on electrochemical reactions on electrode arrays were used to demonstrate the power of mild model-engineered feedback to achieve a desired response. Applications are made to the generation of sequentially visited dynamic cluster patterns similar to reproducible sequences seen in biological systems and to the design of a nonlinear antipacemaker for the destruction of pathological synchronization of a population of interacting oscillators.
