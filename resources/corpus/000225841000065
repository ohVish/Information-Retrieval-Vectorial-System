Phosphorylation of proteins by inositol pyrophosphates
The inositol pyrophosphates IP7 and IP8 contain highly energetic pyrophosphate bonds. Although implicated in various biologic functions, their molecular sites of action have not been clarified. Using radiolabeled IP7, we detected phosphorylation of multiple eukaryotic proteins. We also observed phosphorylation of endogenous proteins by endogenous IP7 in yeast. Phosphorylation by IP7 is nonenzymatic and may represent a novel intracellular signaling mechanism.
