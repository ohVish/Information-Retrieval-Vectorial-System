Paramyxovirus V Proteins Disrupt the Fold of the RNA Sensor MDA5 to Inhibit Antiviral Signaling
The retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptor (RLR) melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) senses cytoplasmic viral RNA and activates antiviral innate immunity. To reveal how paramyxoviruses counteract this response, we determined the crystal structure of the MDA5 adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP)-hydrolysis domain in complex with the viral inhibitor V protein. The V protein unfolded the ATP-hydrolysis domain of MDA5 via a beta-hairpin motif and recognized a structural motif of MDA5 that is normally buried in the conserved helicase fold. This leads to disruption of the MDA5 ATP-hydrolysis site and prevention of RNA-bound MDA5 filament formation. The structure explains why V proteins inactivate MDA5, but not RIG-I, and mutating only two amino acids in RIG-I induces robust V protein binding. Our results suggest an inhibition mechanism of RLR signalosome formation by unfolding of receptor and inhibitor.
