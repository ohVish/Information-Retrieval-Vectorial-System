A circumstellar disk associated with a massive protostellar object
The formation process for stars with masses several times that of the Sun is still unclear. The two main theories are mergers of several low-mass young stellar objects(1), which requires a high stellar density, or mass accretion from circumstellar disks in the same way as low-mass stars are formed(2), accompanied by outflows during the process of gravitational infall. Although a number of disks have been discovered around low- and intermediate-mass young stellar objects(3,4), the presence of disks around massive young stellar objects is still uncertain and the mass of the disk system detected around one such object(5), M17, is disputed(6). Here we report near-infrared imaging polarimetry that reveals an outflow/ disk system around the Becklin - Neugebauer protostellar object, which has a mass of at least seven solar masses (M-.). This strongly supports the theory that stars with masses of at least 7M(.) form in the same way as lower mass stars.
