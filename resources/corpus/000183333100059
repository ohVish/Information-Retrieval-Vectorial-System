Nod1 detects a unique muropeptide from Gram-negative bacterial peptidoglycan
Although the role of Toll-like receptors in extracellular bacterial sensing has been investigated intensively, intracellular detection of bacteria through Nod molecules remains largely uncharacterized. Here, we show that human Nod1 specifically detects a unique diaminopimelate-containing N-acetylglucosamine-N-acetylmuramic acid (GlcNAc-MurNAc) tripeptide motif found in Gram-negative bacterial peptidoglycan, resulting in activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB pathway. Moreover, we show that in epithelial cells (which represent the first line of defense against invasive pathogens), Nod1 is indispensable for intracellular Gram-negative bacterial sensing.
