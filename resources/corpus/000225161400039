G1 cell-cycle control and cancer
Before replicating DNA during their reproductive cycle, our cells enter a phase called G1 during which they interpret a flood of signals that influence cell division and cell fate. Mistakes in this process lead to cancer. An increasingly complex and coherent view of G1 signalling networks, which coordinate cell growth, proliferation, stress management and survival, is helping to define the roots of malignancies and shows promise for the development of better cancer therapies.
