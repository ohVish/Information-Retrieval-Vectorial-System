Feedback regulation of MAPK signalling by an RNA-binding protein
Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are evolutionarily conserved enzymes that convert extracellular signals into various outputs such as cell growth, differentiation and cell death(1-4). MAPK phosphatases selectively inactivate MAPKs by dephosphorylating critical phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine residues(5,6). The transcriptional induction of MAPK phosphatase expression by various stimuli, including MAPK activation, has been well documented as a negative-feedback mechanism of MAPK signalling(7,8). Here we show that Rnc1, a novel K-homology-type RNA-binding protein in fission yeast, binds and stabilizes Pmp1 messenger RNA(9), the MAPK phosphatase for Pmk1 (refs 10, 11). Rnc1 therefore acts as a negative regulator of Pmk1 signalling. Notably, Pmk1 phosphorylates Rnc1, causing enhancement of the RNA-binding activity of Rnc1. Thus, Rnc1 is a component of a new negative-feedback loop that regulates the Pmk1 pathway through its binding to Pmp1 mRNA. Our findings-the post-transcriptional mRNA stabilization of a MAPK phosphatase mediated by an RNA-binding protein-provide an additional regulatory mechanism for fine-tuning of MAPK signalling pathways.
