Structure of the rotor ring of F-type Na+-ATPase from Ilyobacter tartaricus
In the crystal structure of the membrane-embedded rotor ring of the sodium ion-translocating adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) synthase of llyobacter tartaricus at 2.4 angstrom resolution, 11 c subunits are assembled into an hourglass-shaped cylinder with 11-fold symmetry. Sodium ions are bound in a locked conformation close to the outer surface of the cylinder near the middle of the membrane. The structure supports an ion-translocation mechanism in the intact ATP synthase in which the binding site converts from the locked conformation into one that opens toward subunit a as the rotor ring moves through the subunit a/c interface.
