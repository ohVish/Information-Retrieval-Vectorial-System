One-dimensional fast migration of vacancy clusters in metals
The migration of point defects, for example, crystal lattice vacancies and self-interstitial atoms (SIAs), typically occurs through three-dimensional random walk in crystalline solids. However, when vacancies and SIAs agglomerate to form planar clusters, the migration mode may change. We observed nanometer-sized clusters of vacancies exhibiting one-dimensional (1D) fast migration. The 1D migration transported a vacancy cluster containing several hundred vacancies with a mobility higher than that of a single vacancy random walk and a mobility comparable to a single SIA random walk. Moreover, we found that the 1D migration may be a key physical mechanism for self-organization of nanometer-sized sessile vacancy cluster ( stacking fault tetrahedron) arrays. Harnessing this 1D migration mode may enable new control of defect microstructures such as effective defect removal and introduction of ordered nanostructures in materials, including semiconductors.
