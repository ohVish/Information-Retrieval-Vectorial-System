Extending top-down mass spectrometry to proteins with masses greater than 200 kilodaltons
For characterization of sequence and posttranslational modifications, molecular and fragment ion mass data from ionizing and dissociating a protein in the mass spectrometer are far more specific than are masses of peptides from the protein's digestion. We extend the similar to 500-residue, similar to 50-kilodalton (kD) dissociation limitation of this top-down methodology by using electrospray additives, heated vaporization, and separate noncovalent and covalent bond dissociation. This process can cleave 287 interresidue bonds in the termini of a 1314-residue (144-kD) protein, specify previously unidentified disulfide bonds between 8 of 27 cysteines in a 1714-residue (200-kD) protein, and correct sequence predictions in two proteins, one with 2153 residues ( 229 kD).
