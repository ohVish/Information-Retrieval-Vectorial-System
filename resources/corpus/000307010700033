A Newtonian approach to extraordinarily strong negative refraction
Metamaterials with negative refractive indices can manipulate electromagnetic waves in unusual ways, and can be used to achieve, for example, sub-diffraction-limit focusing(1), the bending of light in the 'wrong' direction(2), and reversed Doppler and Cerenkov effects(2). These counterintuitive and technologically useful behaviours have spurred considerable efforts to synthesize a broad array of negative-index metamaterials with engineered electric, magnetic or optical properties(1-10). Here we demonstrate another route to negative refraction by exploiting the inertia of electrons in semiconductor two-dimensional electron gases, collectively accelerated by electromagnetic waves according to Newton's second law of motion, where this acceleration effect manifests as kinetic inductance(11,12). Using kinetic inductance to attain negative refraction was theoretically proposed for three-dimensional metallic nanoparticles(13) and seen experimentally with surface plasmons on the surface of a three-dimensional metal(14). The two-dimensional electron gas that we use at cryogenic temperatures has a larger kinetic inductance than three-dimensional metals, leading to extraordinarily strong negative refraction at gigahertz frequencies, with an index as large as -700. This pronounced negative refractive index and the corresponding reduction in the effective wavelength opens a path to miniaturization in the science and technology of negative refraction.
