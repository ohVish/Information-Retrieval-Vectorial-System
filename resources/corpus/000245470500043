Regulation of a cyclin-CDK-CDK inhibitor complex by inositol pyrophosphates
In budding yeast, phosphate starvation triggers inhibition of the Pho80-Pho85 cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complex by the CDK inhibitor Pho81, leading to expression of genes involved in nutrient homeostasis. We isolated myo-D-inositol heptakisphosphate (IP7) as a cellular component that stimulates Pho81-dependent inhibition of Pho80-Pho85. IP7 is necessary for Pho81- dependent inhibition of Pho80-Pho85 in vitro. Moreover, intracellular concentrations of IP7 increased upon phosphate starvation, and yeast mutants defective in IP7 production failed to inhibit Pho80-Pho85 in response to phosphate starvation. These observations reveal regulation of a cyclin-CDK complex by a metabolite and suggest that a complex metabolic network mediates signaling of phosphate availability.
