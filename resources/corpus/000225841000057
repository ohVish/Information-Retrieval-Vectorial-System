A late-transition metal oxo complex: K7Na9[O=Pt-IV(H2O)L-2]. L = [PW9O34](9-)
Terminal mono-oxo complexes of the late transition metal elements have long been considered too unstable to synthesize because of repulsion between the oxygen electrons and the mostly fitted metal d orbitals. A platinum(IV)-oxo compound flanked by two polytungstate ligands, K7Na9[O=Pt(H2O)L-2], L = [PW9O34](9-), has now been prepared and isolated at room temperature as air-stable brown crystals. X-ray and neutron diffraction at 30 kelvin revealed a very short [1.720(18) angstrom] Pt-O bond and no evidence of a hydrogen atom at the terminal oxygen, ruling out a better precedented Pt-OH complex. Density functional theory and spectroscopic data account for the stability of the Pt(IV)-oxo unit by electron withdrawal into delocalized orbitals of the polytungstates.
