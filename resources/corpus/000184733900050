Discretizing light behaviour in linear and nonlinear waveguide lattices
Light propagating in linear and nonlinear waveguide lattices exhibits behaviour characteristic of that encountered in discrete systems. The diffraction properties of these systems can be engineered, which opens up new possibilities for controlling the flow of light that would have been otherwise impossible in the bulk: these effects can be exploited to achieve diffraction- free propagation and minimize the power requirements for nonlinear processes. In two-dimensional networks of waveguides, self-localized states-or discrete solitons-can travel along 'wire-like' paths and can be routed to any destination port. Such possibilities may be useful for photonic switching architectures.
