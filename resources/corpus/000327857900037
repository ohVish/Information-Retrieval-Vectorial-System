Single-Cell Metabolomics: Analytical and Biological Perspectives
There is currently much interest in broad molecular profiling of single cells; a cell's metabolome-its full complement of small-molecule metabolites-is a direct indicator of phenotypic diversity of single cells and a nearly immediate readout of how cells react to environmental influences. However, the metabolome is very difficult to measure at the single-cell level because of rapid metabolic dynamics, the structural diversity of the molecules, and the inability to amplify or tag small-molecule metabolites. Measurement techniques including mass spectrometry, capillary electrophoresis, and, to a lesser extent, optical spectroscopy and fluorescence detection have led to impressive advances in single-cell metabolomics. Even though none of these methodologies can currently measure the metabolome of a single cell completely, rapidly, and nondestructively, progress has been sufficient such that the field is witnessing a shift from feasibility studies to investigations that yield new biological insight. Particularly interesting fields of application are cancer biology, stem cell research, and monitoring of xenobiotics and drugs in tissue sections at the single-cell level.
