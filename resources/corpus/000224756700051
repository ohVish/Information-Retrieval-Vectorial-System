Elemental and redox analysis of single bacterial cells by X-ray microbeam analysis
High-energy x-ray fluorescence measurements were used to make elemental maps and qualitative chemical analyses of individual Pseudomonas fluorescens strain NCIMB 11764 cells. Marked differences between planktonic and adhered cells were seen in the morphology, elemental composition, and sensitivity to Cr(VI) of hydrated cells at spatial scales of 150 nm. This technology can be applied to natural geomicrobiological systems.
