HIV-1 Nef inhibits ASK1-dependent death signalling providing a potential mechanism for protecting the infected host cell
In vivo infection of lymphatic tissues by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) leads to enhanced apoptosis, which prominently involves uninfected bystander cells(1-3). Increased killing of such bystander cells is mediated in part through Nef induction of Fas ligand (FasL) expression(4-6) on the surface of the virally infected T cells. The subsequent interaction of FasL with Fas (CD95) displayed on neighbouring cells, including HIV-1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, may lead to bystander cell killing and thus forms an important mechanism of immune evasion. As HIV-1 also enhances Fas expression on virally infected cells(7-9), it is unclear how these hosts avoid rapid cell-autonomous apoptosis mediated through cis ligation of Fas by FasL. Here we show that HIV-1 Nef associates with and inhibits apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), a serine/threonine kinase that forms a common and key signalling intermediate in the Fas and tumour-necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) death-signalling pathways(10-12). The interaction of Nef with ASK1 inhibits both Fas- and TNF alpha -mediated apoptosis, as well as the activation of the downstream c-Jun amino-terminal kinase. Our findings reveal a strategy by which HIV-1 Nef promotes the killing of bystander cells through the induction of FasL, while simultaneously protecting the HIV-1-infected host cell from these same pro-apoptotic signals through its interference with ASK1 function.
