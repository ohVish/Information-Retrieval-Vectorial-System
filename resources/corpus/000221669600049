A microfluidic device for conducting gas-liquid-solid hydrogenation reactions
We have developed an efficient system for triphase reactions using a micro-channel reactor. Using this system, we conducted hydrogenation reactions that proceeded smoothly to afford the desired products quantitatively within 2 minutes for a variety of substrates. The system could also be applied to deprotection reactions. We could achieve an effective interaction between hydrogen, substrates, and a palladium catalyst using extremely large interfacial areas and the short path required for molecular diffusion in the very narrow channel space. This concept could be extended to other multiphase reactions that use gas-phase reagents such as oxygen and carbon dioxide.
