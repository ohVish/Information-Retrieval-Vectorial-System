Role of solvent-host interactions that lead to very large swelling of hybrid frameworks
An unusually large expansion upon solvent adsorption occurs without apparent bond breaking in the network of a series of isoreticular chromium(III) or iron(III) diarboxylates labeled MIL-88A to D [dicarbox = fumarate (88A); terephthalate (1,4-BDC) (88B); 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate (2,6-NDC) (88C); and 4-4'-biphenyldicarboxylate (4-4'-BPDC) (88D)]. This reversible "breathing" motion was analyzed in terms of cell dimensions (extent of breathing), movements within the framework (mechanism of transformation), and the interactions between the guests and the skeleton. In situ techniques show that these flexible solids are highly selective absorbents and that this selectivity is strongly dependent on the nature of the organic linker.
