Feedback control of intercellular signalling in development
The intercellular communication that regulates cell fate during animal development must be precisely controlled to avoid dangerous errors. How is this achieved? Recent work has highlighted the importance of positive and negative feedback loops in the dynamic regulation of developmental signalling. These feedback interactions can impart precision, robustness and versatility to intercellular signals. Feedback failure can cause disease.
