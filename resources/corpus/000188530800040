Heterochromatic silencing and HP1 localization in Drosophila are dependent on the RNAi machinery
Genes normally resident in euchromatic domains are silenced when packaged into heterochromatin, as exemplified in Drosophila melanogaster by position effect variegation (PEV). Loss-of-function mutations resulting in suppression of PEV have identified critical components of heterochromatin, including proteins HP1, HP2, and histone H3 lysine 9 methyltransferase. Here, we demonstrate that this silencing is dependent on the RNA interference machinery, using tandem mini-white arrays and white transgenes in heterochromatin to show loss of silencing as a result of mutations in piwi, aubergine, or spindle-E ( homeless), which encode RNAi components. These mutations result in reduction of H3 Lys(9) methylation and delocalization of HP1 and HP2, most dramatically in spindle-E mutants.
