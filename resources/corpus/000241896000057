Ion selectivity in a semisynthetic K+ channel locked in the conductive conformation
Potassium channels are K+-selective protein pores in cell membrane. The selectivity filter is the functional unit that allows K+ channels to distinguish potassium (K+) and sodium (Na+) ions. The filter's structure depends on whether K+ or Na+ ions are bound inside it. We synthesized a K+ channel containing the D-enantiomer of alanine in place of a conserved glycine and found by x-ray crystallography that its filter maintains the K+ (conductive) structure in the presence of Na+ and very low concentrations of K+. This channel conducts Na+ in the absence of K+ but not in the presence of K+. These findings demonstrate that the ability of the channel to adapt its structure differently to K+ and Na+ is a fundamental aspect of ion selectivity, as is the ability of multiple K+ ions to compete effectively with Na+ for the conductive filter.
