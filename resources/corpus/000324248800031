Antibody Therapeutics in Cancer
In a relatively short period of time, monoclonal antibodies have entered the mainstream of cancer therapy. Their first use was as antagonists of oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases, but today monoclonal antibodies have emerged as long-sought vehicles for the targeted delivery of potent chemotherapeutic agents and as powerful tools to manipulate anticancer immune responses. With ever more promising results from the clinic, the future will likely see continued growth in the discovery and development of therapeutic antibodies and their derivatives.
