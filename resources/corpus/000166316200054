Enzymes for chemical synthesis
New catalytic synthetic methods in organic chemistry that satisfy increasingly stringent environmental constraints are in great demand by the pharmaceutical and chemical industries. In addition, novel catalytic procedures are necessary to produce the emerging classes of organic compounds that are becoming the targets of molecular and biomedical research. Enzyme-catalysed chemical transformations are now widely recognized as practical alternatives to traditional (non-biological) organic synthesis, and as convenient solutions to certain intractable synthetic problems.
