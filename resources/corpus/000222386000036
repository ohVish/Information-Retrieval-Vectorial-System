Chiral fiber gratings
Chiral gratings with double helix symmetry were produced by twisting glass optical fiber with a noncircular core cross section as it passed through a miniature oven. We observed polarization-selective transmission in chiral fibers with pitches of tens of micrometers. Two modes of optical interaction were differentiated. In chiral long-period gratings, dips in transmission were observed at wavelengths associated with scattering into distinct cladding modes mediated by the chiral grating. In chiral intermediate-period gratings, a broad scattering band was observed. These gratings can be used to produce sharp or broad polarization-selective filters.
