DNA methylation and epigenetic inheritance in plants and filamentous fungi
Plants and filamentous fungi share with mammals enzymes responsible for DNA methylation. in these organisms, DNA methylation is associated with gene silencing and transposon control. However, plants and fungi differ from mammals in the genomic distribution, sequence specificity, and heritability of methylation. We consider the rote that transposons play in establishing methylation patterns and the epigenetic consequences of their perturbation.
