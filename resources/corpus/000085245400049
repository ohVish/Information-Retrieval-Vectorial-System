Roles of PLC-beta 2 and -beta 3 and PI3K gamma in chemoattractant-mediated signal transduction
The roles of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and phospholipase C (PLC) in chemoattractant-elicited responses were studied in mice lacking these key enzymes. PI3K gamma was required for chemoattractant-induced production of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate [Ptdlns (3,4,5)P-3] and has an important role in chemoattractant-induced superoxide production and chemotaxis in mouse neutrophils and in production of T cell-independent antigen-specific antibodies composed of the immunoglobulin lambda Light chain (Tl-Ig lambda(L). The study of the mice Lacking PLC-beta 2 and -beta 3 revealed that the PLC pathways have an important role in chemoattractant-mediated production of superoxide and regulation of protein kinases, but not chemotaxis. The PLC pathways also appear to inhibit the chemotactic activity induced by certain chemoattractants and to suppress TI-Ig lambda(L) production.
