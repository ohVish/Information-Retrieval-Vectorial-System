Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can lower amyloidogenic A beta(42) by inhibiting Rho
A subset of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been shown to preferentially reduce the secretion of the highly amyloidogenic, 42-residue amyloid-beta peptide Abeta(42). We found that Rho and its effector, Rho-associated kinase, preferentially regulated the amount of Abeta(42) produced in vitro and that only those NSAIDs effective as Rho inhibitors lowered Abeta(42). Administration of Y-27632, a selective Rock inhibitor, also preferentially lowered brain levels of Abeta(42) in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Thus, the Rho-Rock pathway may regulate amyloid precursor protein processing, and a subset of NSAIDs can reduce Abeta(42) through inhibition of Rho activity.
