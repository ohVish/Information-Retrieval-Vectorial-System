Pathological alpha-Synuclein Transmission Initiates Parkinson-like Neurodegeneration in Nontransgenic Mice
Parkinson's disease is characterized by abundant alpha-synuclein (alpha-Syn) neuronal inclusions, known as Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, and the massive loss of midbrain dopamine neurons. However, a cause-and-effect relationship between Lewy inclusion formation and neurodegeneration remains unclear. Here, we found that in wild-type nontransgenic mice, a single intrastriatal inoculation of synthetic alpha-Syn fibrils led to the cell-to-cell transmission of pathologic alpha-Syn and Parkinson's-like Lewy pathology in anatomically interconnected regions. Lewy pathology accumulation resulted in progressive loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, but not in the adjacent ventral tegmental area, and was accompanied by reduced dopamine levels culminating in motor deficits. This recapitulation of a neurodegenerative cascade thus establishes a mechanistic link between transmission of pathologic alpha-Syn and the cardinal features of Parkinson's disease.
