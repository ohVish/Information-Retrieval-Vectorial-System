A functional link between RuBisCO-like protein of Bacillus and photosynthetic RuBisCO
The genomes of several nonphotosynthetic bacteria, such as Bacillus subtilis, and some Archaea include genes for proteins with sequence homology to the large subunit of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO). We found that such a RuBisCO-like protein (RLP) from B. subtilis catalyzed the 2,3-diketo-5-methylthiopentyl-1-phosphate enolase reaction in the methionine salvage pathway. A growth-defective mutant, in which the gene for this RLP had been disrupted, was rescued by the gene for RuBisCO from the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum. Thus, the photosynthetic RuBisCO from R. rubrum retains the ability to function in the methionine salvage pathway in B. subtilis.
