That Was Then But This Is Now: Malaria Research in the Time of an Eradication Agenda
The global research community must take up the challenge to work toward the eradication of malaria. In the past, malaria research has focused on drugs and vaccines that target the blood stage of infection, and mainly on the most deadly species, Plasmodium falciparum, all of which is justified by the need to prevent and treat the disease. This work remains critically important today. However, an increased research focus is now being placed on potential interventions that aim to kill the parasite stages transmitted to and by the mosquito vector because they may represent more vulnerable targets to stop the spread of malaria. Here, we highlight some of the research into malaria parasite biology that has the potential to provide new intervention targets for antimalarial drugs and vaccines.
