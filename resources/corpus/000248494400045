Quantitative mass spectrometry identifies insulin signaling targets in C-elegans
DAF-2, an insulin receptor-like protein, regulates metabolism, development, and aging in Caenorhabditis elegans. In a quantitative proteomic study, we identified 86 proteins that were more or less abundant in long-lived daf-2 mutant worms than in wild-type worms. Genetic studies on a subset of these proteins indicated that they act in one or more processes regulated by DAF-2, including entry into the dauer developmental stage and aging. In particular, we discovered a compensatory mechanism activated in response to reduced DAF-2 signaling, which involves the protein phosphatase calcineurin.
