A molecular molybdenum-oxo catalyst for generating hydrogen from water
A growing awareness of issues related to anthropogenic climate change and an increase in global energy demand have made the search for viable carbon-neutral sources of renewable energy one of the most important challenges in science today(1). The chemical community is therefore seeking efficient and inexpensive catalysts that can produce large quantities of hydrogen gas from water(1-7). Here we identify a molybdenum-oxo complex that can catalytically generate gaseous hydrogen either from water at neutral pH or from sea water. This work shows that high-valency metal-oxo species can be used to create reduction catalysts that are robust and functional in water, a concept that has broad implications for the design of 'green' and sustainable chemistry cycles.
