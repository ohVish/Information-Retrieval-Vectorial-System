Postreplicative formation of cohesion is required for repair and induced by a single DNA break
Sister-chromatid cohesion, established during replication by the protein complex cohesin, is essential for both chromosome segregation and double-strand break (DSB) repair. Normally, cohesion formation is strictly limited to the S phase of the cell cycle, but DSBs can trigger cohesion also after DNA replication has been completed. The function of this damage-induced cohesion remains unknown. In this investigation, we show that damage-induced cohesion is essential for repair in postreplicative cells in yeast. Furthermore, it is established genome-wide after induction of a single DSB, and it is controlled by the DNA damage response and cohesin-regulating factors. We thus define a cohesion establishment pathway that is independent of DNA duplication and acts together with cohesion formed during replication in sister chromatid-based DSB repair.
