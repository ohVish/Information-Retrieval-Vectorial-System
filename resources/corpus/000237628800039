Preparation of poly(diiododiacetylene), an ordered conjugated polymer of carbon and iodine
Conjugated organic polymers generally must include large substituents for stability, either contained within or appended to the polymer chain. In polydiacetylenes, the substituents fulfill another important role: During topochemical polymerization, they control the spacing between the diyne monomers to produce an ordered polymer. By using a co-crystal scaffolding, we have prepared poly( diiododiacetylene), or PIDA, a nearly unadorned carbon chain substituted with only single-atom iodine side groups. The monomer, diiodobutadiyne, forms co-crystals with bis( nitrile) oxalamides, aligned by hydrogen bonds between oxalamide groups and weak Lewis acid-base interactions between nitriles and iodoalkynes. In co-crystals with one oxalamide host, the diyne undergoes spontaneous topochemical polymerization to form PIDA. The structure of the dark blue crystals, which look copper-colored under reflected light, has been confirmed by single-crystal x-ray diffraction, ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy.
