Spin-dependent tunneling in self-assembled cobalt-nanocrystal superlattices
Self-assembled devices composed of periodic arrays of 10-nanometer-diameter cobalt nanocrystals display spin-dependent electron transport. Current-voltage characteristics are well described by single-electron tunneling in a uniform array. At temperatures below 20 kelvin, device magnetoresistance ratios are on the order of 10%, approaching the maximum predicted for ensembles of cobalt islands with randomly oriented preferred magnetic axes. Low-energy spin-flip scattering suppresses magnetoresistance with increasing temperature and bias-voltage.
