Inhibition of hepatitis B virus replication by drug-induced depletion of nucleocapsids
Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major cause of liver disease. Only interferon-alpha and the nucleosidic inhibitors of the viral polymerase, 3TC and adefovir, are approved for therapy. However, these therapies are limited by the side effects of interferon and the substantial resistance of the virus to nucleosidic inhibitors. Potent new antiviral compounds suitable for monotherapy or combination therapy are highly desired. We describe non-nucleosidic inhibitors of HBV nucleocapsid maturation that possess in vitro and in vivo antiviral activity. These inhibitors have potential for future therapeutic regimens to combat chronic HBV infection.
