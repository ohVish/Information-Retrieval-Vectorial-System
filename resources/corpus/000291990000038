A N-15-Poor Isotopic Composition for the Solar System As Shown by Genesis Solar Wind Samples
The Genesis mission sampled solar wind ions to document the elemental and isotopic compositions of the Sun and, by inference, of the protosolar nebula. Nitrogen was a key target element because the extent and origin of its isotopic variations in solar system materials remain unknown. Isotopic analysis of a Genesis Solar Wind Concentrator target material shows that implanted solar wind nitrogen has a N-15/N-14 ratio of 2.18 +/- 0.02 x 10(-3) (that is, approximate to 40% poorer in N-15 relative to terrestrial atmosphere). The N-15/N-14 ratio of the protosolar nebula was 2.27 +/- 0.03 x 10(-3), which is the lowest N-15/N-14 ratio known for solar system objects. This result demonstrates the extreme nitrogen isotopic heterogeneity of the nascent solar system and accounts for the N-15-depleted components observed in solar system reservoirs.
