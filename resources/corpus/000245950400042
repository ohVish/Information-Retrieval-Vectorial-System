Synthesis and medical applications of oligosaccharides
Our understanding of the different glycoconjugates present on cells, proteins and entire organisms is lagging far behind advances in genomics and proteomics. Carbohydrate sequencing and the synthesis of defined oligosaccharides are two key technologies that have contributed to progress in glycomics research. Synthetic tools and high-throughput experiments such as carbohydrate arrays are beginning to affect biological research. These techniques are now being applied to the development of carbohydrate-based diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics.
