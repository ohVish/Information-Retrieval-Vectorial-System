Multiple roles of Arabidopsis VRN1 in vernalization and flowering time control
Arabidopsis VRN genes mediate vernalization, the process by which a long period of cold induces a mitotically stable state that leads to accelerated flowering during later development. VRN1 encodes a protein that binds DNA in vitro in a non sequence-specific manner and functions in stable repression of the major target of the vernalization pathway, the oral repressor FLC. Overexpression of VRN1 reveals a vernalization-independent function for VRN1, mediated predominantly through the oral pathway integrator FT, and demonstrates that VRN1 requires vernalization-specific factors to target FLC.
