Tunneling spectroscopy of them elementary excitations in a one-dimensional wire
The collective excitation spectrum of interacting electrons in one dimension has been measured by controlling the energy and momentum of electrons tunneling between two closely spaced, parallel quantum wires in a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure while measuring the resulting conductance. The excitation spectrum deviates from the noninteracting spectrum, attesting to the importance of Coulomb interactions. An observed 30% enhancement! of the excitation velocity relative to noninteracting electrons with the same density, a parameter determined experimentally, is consistent with theories on interacting electrons in one dimension. In short wires, 6 and 2 micrometers long, finite size effects, resulting from the breaking of translational invariance, are observed.
