Field-induced superconductivity in a spin-ladder cuprate
We report on the modulation of the transport properties of thin films, grown by molecular beam epitaxy, of the spin-ladder compound [CaCu2O3](4), using the field effect in a gated structure. At high hole-doping levels, superconductivity is induced in the nominally insulating [adder material without the use of high-pressure or chemical substitution. The observation of superconductivity is in agreement with the theoretical prediction that holes doped into spin ladders could pair and possibly superconduct.
