Hepatitis C virus IRES RNA-induced changes in the conformation of the 40S ribosomal subunit
Initiation of protein synthesis in eukaryotes requires recruitment of the 40S ribosomal subunit to the messenger RNA(mRNA). In most cases, this depends on recognition of a modified nucleotide cap on the 5' end of the mRNA. However, an alternate pathway uses a structured RNA element in the 5' untranslated region of the messenger or viral RNA called an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES). Here, we present a cryo-electron microscopy map of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) IRES bound to the 40S ribosomal subunit at about 20 Angstrom resolution. IRES binding induces a pronounced conformational change in the 40S subunit and closes the mRNA binding cleft, suggesting a mechanism for IRES-mediated positioning of mRNA in the ribosomal decoding center.
