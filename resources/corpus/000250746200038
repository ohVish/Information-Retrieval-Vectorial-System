Drosophila and the genetics of the internal milieu
'Homeostasis', from the Greek words for 'same' and 'steady', refers to ways in which the body acts to maintain a stable internal environment despite perturbations. Recent studies in Drosophila exemplify the conservation of regulatory mechanisms involved in metabolic homeostasis. These new findings underscore the use of Drosophila as a model for the study of various human disorders.
