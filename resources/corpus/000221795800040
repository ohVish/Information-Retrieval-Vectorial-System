The acquisition of exogenous algal symbionts by an octocoral after bleaching
Episodes of coral bleaching (loss of the symbiotic dinoflagellates) and coral mortality have occurred with increasing frequency over the past two decades. Although some corals recover from bleaching events, the source of the repopulating symbionts is unknown. Here we show that after bleaching, the adult octocoral Briareum sp. acquire dinoflagellate symbionts (Symbiodinium sp.) from the environment. Uptake of exogenous symbionts provides a mechanism for response to changes in the environment and resilience in the symbiosis.
