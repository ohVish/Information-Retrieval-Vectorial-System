Postsynaptic induction of BDNF-mediated long-term potentiation
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and other neurotrophins are critically involved in long-term potentiation (LTP). Previous reports point to a presynaptic site of neurotrophin action. By imaging dentate granule cells in mouse hippocampal slices, we identified BDNF-evoked Ca2+ transients in dendrites and spines, but not at presynaptic sites. Pairing a weak burst of synaptic stimulation with a brief dendritic BDNF application caused an immediate and robust induction of LTP. LTP induction required activation of postsynaptic Ca2+ channels and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and was prevented by the blockage of postsynaptic Call transients. Thus, our results suggest that BDNF-mediated LTP is induced postsynaptically. Our finding that dendritic spines are the exclusive synaptic sites for rapid BDNF-evoked Ca2+ signaling supports this conclusion.
