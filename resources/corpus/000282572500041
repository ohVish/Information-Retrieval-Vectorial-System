Phosphorylation of the CPC by Cdk1 promotes chromosome bi-orientation
Successful partition of replicated genomes at cell division requires chromosome attachment to opposite poles of mitotic spindle (bi-orientation). Any defects in this regulation bring about chromosomal instability, which may accelerate tumour progression in humans. To achieve chromosome bi-orientation at prometaphase, the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), composed of catalytic kinase Aurora B and regulatory components (INCENP, Survivin and Borealin), must be localized to centromeres to phosphorylate kinetochore substrates(1-7). Although the CPC dynamically changes the subcellular localization, the regulation of centromere targeting is largely unknown(1). Here we isolated a fission yeast cyclin B mutant defective specifically in chromosome bi-orientation. Accordingly, we identified Cdk1 (also known as Cdc2)-cyclin-B-dependent phosphorylation of Survivin. Preventing Survivin phosphorylation impairs centromere CPC targeting as well as chromosome bi-orientation, whereas phosphomimetic Survivin suppresses the bi-orientation defect in the cyclin B mutant. Survivin phosphorylation promotes direct binding with shugoshin(8,9), which we now define as a conserved centromeric adaptor of the CPC. In human cells, the phosphorylation of Borealin has a comparable role. Thus, our study resolves the conserved mechanisms of CPC targeting to centromeres, highlighting a key role of Cdk1-cyclin B in chromosome bi-orientation.
