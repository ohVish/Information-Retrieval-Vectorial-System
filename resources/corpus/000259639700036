Challenges in the development of an HIV-1 vaccine
The development of a safe and effective human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 vaccine is a critically important global health priority. Despite recent advances in our understanding of HIV-1 pathogenesis and immunology, however, major scientific obstacles remain. Prototype HIV-1 vaccine candidates aimed at eliciting humoral and cellular immune responses have so far failed to protect against HIV- 1 infection or to reduce viral loads after infection in clinical efficacy studies. A renewed and coordinated commitment to basic discovery research, preclinical studies and clinical trials will therefore be required to overcome the hurdles currently facing the field. Here I review key challenges and future prospects in the quest to develop a prophylactic HIV- 1 vaccine.
