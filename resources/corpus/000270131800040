Coordinatively Unsaturated Al3+ Centers as Binding Sites for Active Catalyst Phases of Platinum on gamma-Al2O3
In many heterogeneous catalysts, the interaction of metal particles with their oxide support can alter the electronic properties of the metal and can play a critical role in determining particle morphology and maintaining dispersion. We used a combination of ultrahigh magnetic field, solid-state magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy coupled with density functional theory calculations to reveal the nature of anchoring sites of a catalytically active phase of platinum on the surface of a gamma-Al2O3 catalyst support material. The results obtained show that coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ (Al-penta(3+)) centers present on the (100) facets of the gamma-Al2O3 surface are anchoring Pt. At low loadings, the active catalytic phase is atomically dispersed on the support surface (Pt/Al-penta(3+) = 1), whereas two-dimensional Pt rafts form at higher coverages.
