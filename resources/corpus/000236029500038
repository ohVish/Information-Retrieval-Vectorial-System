Microstructured optical fibers as high-pressure microfluidic reactors
Deposition of semiconductors and metals from chemical precursors onto planar substrates is a well-developed science and technology for microelectronics. Optical fibers are an established platform for both communications technology and fundamental research in photonics. Here, we describe a hybrid technology that integrates key aspects of both engineering disciplines, demonstrating the fabrication of tubes, solid nanowires, coaxial heterojunctions, and longitudinally patterned structures composed of metals, single-crystal semiconductors, and polycrystalline elemental or compound semiconductors within microstructured silica optical fibers. Because the optical fibers are constructed and the functional materials are chemically deposited in distinct and independent steps, the full design flexibilities of both platforms can now be exploited simultaneously for fiber-integrated optoelectronic materials and devices.
