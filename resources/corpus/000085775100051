Light acts directly on organs and cells in culture to set the vertebrate circadian clock
The expression of dock genes in vertebrates is widespread and not restricted to classical dock structures(1,2). The expression of the Clock gene in zebrafish shows a strong circadian oscillation in many tissues in vivo and in culture, showing that endogenous oscillators exist in peripheral organs(3). A defining feature of circadian clocks is that they can be set or entrained to local time, usually by the environmental light-dark cycle(4,5). An important question is whether peripheral oscillators are entrained to local time by signals from central pacemakers such as the eyes or are themselves directly light-responsive. Here we show that the peripheral organ docks of zebrafish are set by light-dark cycles in culture. We also show that a zebrafish-derived cell line contains a circadian oscillator, which is also directly light entrained.
