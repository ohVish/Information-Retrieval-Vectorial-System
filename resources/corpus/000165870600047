The origins of genomic duplications in Arabidopsis
Large segmental duplications cover much of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome. Little is known about their origins. We show that they are primarily due to at Least four different Large-scale duplication events that occurred 100 to 200 million years ago. a formative period in the diversification of the angiosperms. A better understanding of the complex structural history of angiosperm genomes is necessary to make full use of Arabidopsis as a genetic model for other plant species.
