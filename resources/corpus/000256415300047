An endogenous small interfering RNA pathway in Drosophila
Drosophila endogenous small RNAs are categorized according to their mechanisms of biogenesis and the Argonaute protein to which they bind. MicroRNAs are a class of ubiquitously expressed RNAs of 22 nucleotides in length, which arise from structured precursors through the action of Drosha - Pasha and Dicer- 1-Loquacious complexes(1-7). These join Argonaute-1 to regulate gene expression(8,9). A second endogenous small RNA class, the Piwi-interacting RNAs, bind Piwi proteins and suppress transposons(10,11). Piwi- interacting RNAs are restricted to the gonad, and at least a subset of these arises by Piwi- catalysed cleavage of single-stranded RNAs(12,13). Here we show that Drosophila generates a third small RNA class, endogenous small interfering RNAs, in both gonadal and somatic tissues. Production of these RNAs requires Dicer- 2, but a subset depends preferentially on Loquacious(1,4,5) rather than the canonical Dicer- 2 partner, R2D2 ( ref. 14). Endogenous small interfering RNAs arise both from convergent transcription units and from structured genomic loci in a tissue- specific fashion. They predominantly join Argonaute- 2 and have the capacity, as a class, to target both protein- coding genes and mobile elements. These observations expand the repertoire of small RNAs in Drosophila, adding a class that blurs distinctions based on known biogenesis mechanisms and functional roles.
