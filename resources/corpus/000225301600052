TRPM4 regulates calcium oscillations after T cell activation
TRPM4 has recently been described as a calcium-activated nonselective (CAN) cation channel that mediates membrane depolarization. However, the functional importance of TRPM4 in the context of calcium (Ca2+) signaling and its effect on cellular responses are not known. Here, the molecular inhibition of endogenous TRPM4 in T cells was shown to suppress TRPM4 currents, with a profound influence on receptor-mediated Ca2+ mobilization. Agonist-mediated oscillations in intracellutar Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+](i)), which are driven by store-operated Ca2+ influx, were transformed into a sustained elevation in [Ca2+](i). This increase in Ca2+ influx enhanced interleukin-2 production. Thus, TRPM4-mediated depolarization modulates Ca2+ oscillations, with downstream effects on cytokine production in T lymphocytes.
