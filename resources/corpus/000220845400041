Robotic observations of enhanced carbon biomass and export at 55 degrees S during SOFeX
Autonomous. oats pro. ling in high-nitrate low-silicate waters of the Southern Ocean observed carbon biomass variability and carbon exported to depths of 100 m during the 2002 Southern Ocean Iron Experiment (SOFeX) to detect the effects of iron fertilization of surface water there. Control and "in-patch" measurements documented a greater than fourfold enhancement of carbon biomass in the iron-amended waters. Carbon export through 100 m increased two- to sixfold as the patch subducted below a front. The molar ratio of iron added to carbon exported ranged between 10(4) and 10(5). The biomass buildup and export were much higher than expected for iron-amended low-silicate waters.
