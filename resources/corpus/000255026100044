Reconstitution of pilus assembly reveals a bacterial outer membrane catalyst
Type 1 pili from uropathogenic Escherichia coli are a prototype of adhesive surface organelles assembled and secreted by the conserved chaperone/ usher pathway. We reconstituted type 1 pilus biogenesis from purified pilus proteins. The usher FimD acted as a catalyst to accelerate the ordered assembly of protein subunits independently of cellular energy. Its activity was highly dependent on the adhesin subunit FimH, which triggered the conversion of FimD into a high-efficiency assembly catalyst. Furthermore, a simple kinetic model adequately rationalized usher- catalyzed pilus assembly in vivo. Our results contribute to a mechanistic understanding of protein- catalyzed biogenesis of supramolecular protein complexes at the bacterial outer cell membrane.
