Three-dimensional mapping of dislocation avalanches: Clustering and space/time coupling
There is growing evidence for the complex, intermittent, and heterogeneous character of plastic flow. Here we report a three-dimensional mapping of dislocation avalanches during creep deformation of an ice crystal, from a multiple-transducers acoustic emission analysis. Correlation analysis shows that dislocation avalanches are spatially clustered according to a fractal pattern and that the closer in time two avalanches are, the larger the probability is that they will be closer in space. Such a space/time coupling may contribute to the self-organization of the avalanches into a clustered pattern.
