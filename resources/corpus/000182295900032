Multifunctional alloys obtained via a dislocation-free plastic deformation mechanism
We describe a group of alloys that exhibit "super" properties, such as ultralow elastic modulus, ultrahigh strength, super elasticity, and super plasticity, at room temperature and that show Elinvar and Invar behavior. These "super" properties are attributable to a dislocation-free plastic deformation mechanism. In cold-worked alloys, this mechanism forms elastic strain fields of hierarchical structure that range in size from the nanometer scale to several tens of micrometers. The resultant elastic strain energy leads to a number of enhanced material properties.
