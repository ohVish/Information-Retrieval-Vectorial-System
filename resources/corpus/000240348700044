Humanization of yeast to produce complex terminally sialylated glycoproteins
Yeast is a widely used recombinant protein expression system. We expanded its utility by engineering the yeast Pichia pastoris to secrete human glycoproteins with fully complex terminally sialylated N-glycans. After the knockout of four genes to eliminate yeast-specific glycosylation, we introduced 14 heterologous genes, allowing us to replicate the sequential steps of human glycosylation. The reported cell lines produce complex glycoproteins with greater than 90% terminal sialylation. Finally, to demonstrate the utility of these yeast strains, functional recombinant erythropoietin was produced.
