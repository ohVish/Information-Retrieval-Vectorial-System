Induction of mating in Candida albicans by construction of MTLa and MTL alpha strains
Although the diploid fungus Candida albicans, a human pathogen, has been thought to have no sexual cycle. it normally possesses mating-type-like orthologs (Mn) of both of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae mating-type genes (MAT) a and alpha. When strains containing only MTLa or MTL alpha were constructed by the Loss of one homolog of chromosome 5, the site of the MTL Loci, MTLa and MTL alpha strains mated, but like mating types did not. Evidence for mating included formation of stable prototrophs from strains with complementing auxotrophic markers; these contained both MTL alleles and molecular markers from both parents and were tetraploid in DNA content and mononucleate.
