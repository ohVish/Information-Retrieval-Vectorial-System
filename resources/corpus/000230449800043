FKF1F-BOX protein mediates cyclic degradation of a repressor of CONSTANS in Arabidopsis
The temporal control of CONSTANS (CO) expression and activity is a key mechanism in photoperiodic flowering in Arabidopsis. FLAVIN-BINDING, KELCH REPEAT, F-BOX 1 (FKF1) protein regulates CO transcription, although the molecular mechanism is unknown. We demonstrate here that FKF1 controls the stability of a Dof transcription factor, CYCLING DOF FACTOR 1 (CDF1). FKF1 physically interacts with CDF1, and CDF1 protein is more stable in fkf1 mutants. Plants with elevated levels of CDF1 flower late and have reduced expression of CO. CDF1 and CO are expressed in the same tissues, and CDF1 binds to the CO promoter. Thus, FKF1 controls daily CO expression in part by degrading CDF1, a repressor of CO transcription.
