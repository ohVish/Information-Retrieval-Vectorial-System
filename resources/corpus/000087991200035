Inspiration for optimization from social insect behaviour
Research in social insect behaviour has provided computer scientists with powerful methods for designing distributed control and optimization algorithms. These techniques are being applied successfully to a variety of scientific and engineering problems. In addition to achieving good performance on a wide spectrum of 'static' problems, such techniques tend to exhibit a high degree of flexibility and robustness in a dynamic environment.
