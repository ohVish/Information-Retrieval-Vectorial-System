Transient interface sharpening in miscible alloys
We observed that diffuse interfaces sharpen rather than broaden in completely miscible ideal binary systems. This is shown in situ during heat treatments at gradually increasing temperatures by scattering of synchrotron radiation in coherent Mo/V multilayers containing initially diffuse interfaces. This effect provides a useful tool for the improvement of interfaces and offers a way to fabricate better x-ray or neutron mirrors, microelectronic devices, or multilayers with giant magnetic resistance.
