The Earth's missing lead may not be in the core
Relative to the CI chondrite class of meteorites (widely thought to be the ` building blocks' of the terrestrial planets), the Earth is depleted in volatile elements. For most elements this depletion is thought to be a solar nebular signature, as chondrites show depletions qualitatively similar to that of the Earth(1). Onthe other hand, as lead is a volatile element, some Pb may also have been lost after accretion. The unique (206)Pb/(204)Pb and (207)Pb/(204)Pb ratios of the Earth's mantle suggest that some lead was lost about 50 to 130 Myr after Solar System formation(2-4). This has commonly been explained by lead lost via the segregation of a sulphide melt to the Earth's core(5-7), which assumes that lead has an affinity towards sulphide. Some models, however, have reconciled the Earth's lead deficit with volatilization(8). Which ever model is preferred, the broad coincidence of U-Pb model ages with the age of the Moon(9-11) suggests that lead loss may be related to the Moon- forming impact. Here we report partitioning experiments in metal - sulphide - silicate systems. We show that lead is neither siderophile nor chalcophile enough to explain the high U/Pb ratio of the Earth'smantle as being a result of lead pumping to the core. The Earth may have accreted from initially volatile- depleted material, some lead may have been lost to degassing following the Moon- forming giant impact, or a hidden reservoir exists in the deep mantle with lead isotope compositions complementary to upper- mantle values; it is unlikely though that the missing lead resides in the core.
