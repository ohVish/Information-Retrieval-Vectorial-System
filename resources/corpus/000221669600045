Photon-induced Kondo satellites in a single-electron transistor
We measure the differential conductance of a single-electron transistor ( SET) irradiated with microwaves. The spin-entangled many-electron Kondo state produces a zero-bias peakin the dc differential conductance if the quantum dot in the SET contains an unpaired electron. When the photon energy hf is comparable to the energy width of the Kondo peak and to e ( the charge on the electron) times the microwave voltage across the dot, satellites appear in the differential conductance shifted in voltage by +/-hf/e from the zero-bias resonance. We also observe an overall suppression of the Kondo features with increasing microwave voltage.
