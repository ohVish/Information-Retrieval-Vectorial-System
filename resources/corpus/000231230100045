Direct control of germline stem cell division and cyst growth by neural insulin in Drosophila
Stem cells reside in specialized niches that provide signals required for their maintenance and division. Tissue-extrinsic signals can also modify stem cell activity, although this is poorly understood. Here, we report that neural-derived Drosophila insulin-like peptides (DILPs) directly regulate germline stem cell division rate, demonstrating that signals mediating the ovarian response to nutritional input can modify stem cell activity in a niche-independent manner. We also reveal a crucial direct role of DILPs in controlling germline cyst growth and vitellogenesis.
