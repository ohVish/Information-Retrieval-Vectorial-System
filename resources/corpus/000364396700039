Entangling two transportable neutral atoms via local spin exchange
To advance quantum information science, physical systems are sought that meet the stringent requirements for creating and preserving quantum entanglement. In atomic physics, robust two-qubit entanglement is typically achieved by strong, long-range interactions in the form of either Coulomb interactions between ions or dipolar interactions between Rydberg atoms(1-4). Although such interactions allow fast quantum gates, the interacting atoms must overcome the associated coupling to the environment and crosstalk among qubits(5-)8. Local interactions, such as those requiring substantial wavefunction overlap, can alleviate these detrimental effects; however, such interactions present a new challenge: to distribute entanglement, qubits must be transported, merged for interaction, and then isolated for storage and subsequent operations. Here we show how, using a mobile optical tweezer, it is possible to prepare and locally entangle two ultracold neutral atoms, and then separate them while preserving their entanglement(9-11). Ground-state neutral atom experiments have measured dynamics consistent with spin entanglement(10,12,13), and have detected entanglement with macroscopic observables(14,15); we are now able to demonstrate position-resolved two-particle coherence via application of a local gradient and parity measurements'. This new entanglement-verification protocol could be applied to arbitrary spin-entangled states of spatially separated atoms(16,17). The local entangling operation is achieved via spin-exchange interactions(9-11), and quantum tunnelling is used to combine and separate atoms. These techniques provide a framework for dynamically entangling remote qubits via local operations within a large-scale quantum register.
