Stable low-pressure hydrogen clusters stored in a binary clathrate hydrate
Thermodynamic, x-ray diffraction, and Raman and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements show that clusters of H-2 can be stabilized and stored at low pressures in a sll binary clathrate hydrate. Clusters of H-2 molecules occupy small water cages, whereas large water cages are singly occupied by tetrahydrofuran. The presence of this second guest component stabilizes the clathrate at pressures of 5 megapascals at 279.6 kelvin, versus 300 megapascals at 280 kelvin for pure H-2 hydrate.
