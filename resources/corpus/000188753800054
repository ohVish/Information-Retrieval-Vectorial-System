48,000 years of climate and forest change in a biodiversity hot spot
A continuous 48,000-year-long paleoecological record from Neotropical lower montane forest reveals a consistent forest presence and an ice-age cooling of similar to5degrees to 9degreesC. After 30,000 years of compositional stability, a steady turnover of species marks the 8000-year-long transition from ice-age to Holocene conditions. Although the changes were directional, the rates of community change were no different during this transitional period than in the preceding 30,000-year period of community stability. The warming rate of about 1degreesC per millennium during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition was an order of magnitude less than the projected changes for the 21st century.
