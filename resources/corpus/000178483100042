A correlation between mid-ocean-ridge basalt chemistry and distance to continents
To fully understand the structure and dynamics of the Earth's convecting mantle, the origins of temperature variations within the mantle need to be resolved. Different hypotheses have been proposed to account for these temperature variations: for example, heat coming from the decay of radioactive elements or heat flowing out of the Earth's core. In addition, theoretical studies(1-5) suggest that the thermal properties of continental masses can affect mantle convection, but quantitative data that could allow us to test these models are scarce. To address this latter problem, we have examined the chemistry of mid-ocean-ridge basalt-which reflects the temperature of the source mantle(6,7)-as a function of the distance of the ridge from the closest continental margin. No correlation is observed for oceanic ridges close to subduction zones or hotspots; subduction zones probably inhibit thermal transfer between the mantle beneath continents and ocean, whereas hotspots influence the major-element chemistry of ridge basalts, which makes their interpretation with respect to mantle temperature more difficult. However, we do observe a significant correlation for mid-oceanic basalts from the Atlantic and Indian oceans. From this, we conclude that the location of continental masses relative to active ridges influences the large-scale thermal structure of the mantle and we estimate that the mantle cools by 0.05 to 0.1degreesC per kilometre from the continental margins.
