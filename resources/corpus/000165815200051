Adherens junctions and beta-catenin-mediated cell signalling in a non-metazoan organism
Mechanical forces between cells have a principal role in the organization of animal tissues. Adherens junctions are an important component of these tissues, connecting cells through their actin cytoskeleton and allowing the assembly of tensile structures(1-4). At least one adherens junction protein, beta -catenin, also acts as a signalling molecule, directly regulating gene expression(5-7). To date, adherens junctions have only been detected in metazoa, and therefore we looked for them outside the animal kingdom to examine their evolutionary origins. The non-metazoan Dictyostelium discoideum forms a multicellular, differentiated structure(8). Here we describe the discovery of actin-associated intercellular junctions in Dictyostelium. We have isolated a gene encoding a beta -catenin homologue, aardvark, which is a component of the junctional complex, and, independently, is required for cell signalling. Our discovery of adherens junctions outside the animal kingdom shows that the dual role of beta -catenin in cell-cell adhesion and cell sig-nailing evolved before the origins of metazoa.
