Mitochondrial FtsZ in a chromophyte alga
A homolog of the bacterial cell division gene ftsZ was isolated from the alga Mallomonas splendens. The nuclear-encoded protein (MsFtsZ-mt) was closely related to FtsZs of the alpha-proteobacteria, possessed a mitochondrial targeting signal, and localized in a pattern consistent with a role in mitochondrial division. Although FtsZs are known to act in the division of chloroplasts, MsFtsZ-mt appears to be a mitochondrial FtsZ and may represent a mitochondrial division protein.
