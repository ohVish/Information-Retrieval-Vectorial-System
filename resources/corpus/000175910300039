A cyclic model of the universe
We propose a cosmological model in which the universe undergoes an endless sequence of cosmic epochs that begin with a "bang" and end in a "crunch." Temperature and density at the transition remain finite. Instead of having an inflationary epoch, each cycle includes a period of slow accelerated expansion (as recently observed) followed by contraction that produces the homogeneity, flatness, and energy needed to begin the next cycle.
