The RAR1 interactor SGT1, an essential component of R gene-triggered disease resistance
Plant disease resistance (R) genes trigger innate immune responses upon pathogen attack. RAR1 is an early convergence: point in a signaling pathway engaged by multiple R genes. Here, vie show that RAR1 interacts with plant orthologs of the yeast protein SGT1, an essential regulator in the cell cycle. Silencing the barley gene Sgt1 reveals its role in R gene-triggered, Rar1-dependent disease resistance. SGT1 associates with SKP1 and CUL1, subunits of the SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F-box) ubiquitin ligase complex. Furthermore, the RAR1-SGT1 complex also interacts with two COP9 signalosome components. The interactions among RAR1, SGT1, SCF, and signalosome subunits indicate a link between disease resistance and ubiquitination.
