Vesicle endocytosis requires dynamin-dependent GTP hydrolysis at a fast CNS synapse
Molecular dependence of vesicular endocytosis was investigated with capacitance measurements at the calyx of Held terminal in brainstem slices. Intraterminal loading of botulinum toxin E revealed that the rapid capacitance transient implicated as "kiss-and-run" was unrelated to transmitter release. The release-related capacitance. change decayed with an endocytotic time constant of 10 to 25 seconds, depending on the magnitude of exocytosis. Presynaptic loading of the nonhydrolyzable guanosine, 5'-triphosphate (GTP) analog GTPgammaS or dynamin-1 proline-rich domain peptide abolished endocytosis. These compounds had no immediate effect on exocytosis, but caused a use-dependent rundown of exocytosis. Thus, the guanosine triphosphatase dynamin-1 is indispensable for vesicle endocytosis at this fast central nervous system (CNS) synapse.
