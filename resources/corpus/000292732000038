Real-Space Imaging of Kondo Screening in a Two-Dimensional O-2 Lattice
Kondo lattice systems can exhibit unusual many-body behaviors that result from the interplay between onsite Kondo screening and intersite coupling. We used scanning tunneling microscopy to image the Kondo resonance in a nonconventional Kondo lattice formed by self-assembled oxygen (O-2) molecules, which are paramagnetic, on the gold reconstructed surface [Au(110)-1x2]. The interplay between the intermolecular coupling for molecules adsorbed along chains and the onsite Kondo effect leads to the coexistence of both local and nonlocal Kondo screening at the atomic level. The latter provides evidence for collective deconfinement of magnetization induced in Au, whereas the former shows local "hybridization" between the Kondo clouds of nearest-neighbor O-2 molecules.
