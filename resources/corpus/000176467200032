Strongly correlated superconductivity
High-temperature superconductivity in doped Mott insulators such as the cuprates contradicts the conventional wisdom that electron repulsion is detrimental to superconductivity. Because doped fullerene conductors are also strongly correlated, the recent discovery of high-critical-temperature, presumably s-wave, superconductivity in C-60 field effect devices is even more puzzling. We examine a dynamical mean-field solution of a model for electron-doped fullerenes that shows how strong correlations can indeed enhance superconductivity close to the Mott transition. We argue that the mechanism responsible for this enhancement could be common to a wider class of strongly correlated models, including those for cuprate superconductors.
