Cubic AgPbmSbTe2+m: Bulk thermoelectric materials with high figure of merit
The conversion of heat to electricity by thermoelectric devices may play a key role in the future for energy production and utilization. However, in order to meet that role, more efficient thermoelectric materials are needed that are suitable for high-temperature applications. We show that the material system AgPbm SbTe2+m may be suitable for this purpose. With m=10 and 18 and doped appropriately, n-type semiconductors can be produced that exhibit a high thermoelectric figure of merit material ZT(max) of similar to2.2 at 800 kelvin. In the temperature range 600 to 900 kelvin, the AgPbm SbTe2+m material is expected to outperform all reported bulk thermoelectrics, thereby earmarking it as a material system for potential use in efficient thermoelectric power generation from heat sources.
