Somatic support cells restrict germline stem cell self-renewal and promote differentiation
Stem cells maintain populations of highly differentiated, short-lived cell-types, including blood, skin and sperm, throughout adult life(1). Understanding the mechanisms that regulate stem cell behaviour is crucial for realizing their potential in regenerative medicine(2). A fundamental characteristic of stem cells is their capacity for asymmetric division: daughter cells either retain stem cell identity or initiate differentiation. However, stem cells are also capable of symmetric division where both daughters remain stem cells(3-6), indicating that mechanisms must exist to balance self-renewal capacity with differentiation. Here we present evidence that support cells surrounding the stem cells restrict self-renewal and control stem cell number by ensuring asymmetric division. Loss of function of the Drosophila Epidermal growth factor receptor in somatic cells disrupted the balance of self-renewal versus differentiation in the male germline, increasing the number of germline stem cells. We propose that activation of this receptor specifies normal behaviour of somatic support cells; in turn, the somatic cells play a guardian role, providing information that prevents self-renewal of stem cell identity by the germ cell they enclose.
