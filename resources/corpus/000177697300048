Controlled elimination of clathrin heavy-chain expression in DT40 lymphocytes
We exploited the high rate of homologous recombination shown by the chicken B cell line DT40 to inactivate the endogenous alleles for clathrin heavy chain and replace them with human clathrin complementary DNA under the control of a tetracycline-regulatable promoter. Clathrin repression perturbed the activities of Akt-mediated and mitogen-activated protein kinase mediated signaling pathways and induced apoptosis; this finding suggests that in DT40 cells clathrin helps to maintain the integrity of antiapoptotic survival pathways. We also describe a variant cell line in which these signaling pathways were unaffected by clathrin down-regulation. This variant cell line did not undergo apoptosis in the absence of clathrin and was used to examine the effects of clathrin depletion on membrane-trafficking pathways. Receptor-mediated and fluid-phase endocytosis were both substantially inhibited, and transferrin-receptor recycling was modestly inhibited. Surprisingly, clathrin removal did not affect the morphology or biochemical composition of lysosomes.
