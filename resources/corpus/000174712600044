Self-assembly of phase-segregated liquid crystal structures
Additional functionality can be incorporated into liquid crystalline materials by using phase segregation and self-assembly. Intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding and ionic interactions play key roles in the formation of these complex structures. One-, two-, and three-dimensional phase-segregated structures on various scales of length are formed by self-assembty of a variety of partially incompatible molecules. Such structures can enhance anisotropic properties such as ionic conductivity.
