High-valent organometallic copper and palladium in catalysis
Copper and palladium catalysts are critically important in numerous commercial chemical processes. Improvements in the activity, selectivity and scope of these catalysts could drastically reduce the environmental impact, and increase the sustainability, of chemical reactions. One rapidly developing strategy for achieving these goals is to use 'high-valent' organometallic copper and palladium intermediates in catalysis. Here we describe recent advances involving both the fundamental chemistry and the applications of these high-valent metal complexes in numerous synthetically useful catalytic transformations.
