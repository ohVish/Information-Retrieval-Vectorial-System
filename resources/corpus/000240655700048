Therapy-induced acute recruitment of circulating endothelial progenitor cells to tumors
The contribution of bone marrow-derived circulating endothelial progenitor cells (CEPs) to tumor angiogenesis has been controversial, primarily because of their low numbers in blood vessels of untreated tumors. We show that treatment of tumor-bearing mice with vascular disrupting agents (VDAs) leads to an acute mobilization of CEPs, which home to the viable tumor rim that characteristically remains after such therapy. Disruption of this CEP spike by antiangiogenic drugs or by genetic manipulation resulted in marked reductions in tumor rim size and blood flow as well as enhanced VDA antitumor activity. These findings also provide a mechanistic rationale for the enhanced efficacy of VDAs when combined with antiangiogenic drugs.
