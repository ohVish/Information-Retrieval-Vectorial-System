Sign-Problem-Free Quantum Monte Carlo of the Onset of Antiferromagnetism in Metals
The quantum theory of antiferromagnetism in metals is necessary for our understanding of numerous intermetallic compounds of widespread interest. In these systems, a quantum critical point emerges as external parameters (such as chemical doping) are varied. Because of the strong coupling nature of this critical point and the "sign problem" plaguing numerical quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods, its theoretical understanding is still incomplete. Here, we show that the universal low-energy theory for the onset of antiferromagnetism in a metal can be realized in lattice models, which are free from the sign problem and hence can be simulated efficiently with QMC. Our simulations show Fermi surface reconstruction and unconventional spin-singlet superconductivity across the critical point.
