Physical structure and inversion charge at a semiconductor interface with a crystalline oxide
We show that the physical and electrical structure and hence the inversion charge for crystalline oxides on semiconductors can be understood and systematically manipulated at the atomic Level. Heterojunction band offset and alignment are adjusted by atomic-level structural and chemical changes, resulting in the demonstration of an electrical interface between a polar oxide and a semiconductor free of interface charge. In a broader sense, we take the metal oxide semiconductor device to a new and prominent position in the solid-state electronics timeline, It can now be extensively developed using an entirely new physical system: the crystalline oxides-on-semiconductors interface.
