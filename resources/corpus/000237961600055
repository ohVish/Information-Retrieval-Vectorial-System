A new genus of African monkey, Rungwecebus: Morphology, ecology, and molecular phylogenetics
A new species of African monkey, Lophocebus kipunji, was described in 2005 based on observations from two sites in Tanzania. We have since obtained a specimen killed by a farmer on Mount Rungwe, the type locality. Detailed molecular phylogenetic analyses of this specimen demonstrate that the genus Lophocebus is diphyletic. We provide a description of a new genus of African monkey and of the only preserved specimen of this primate. We also present information on the animal's ecology and conservation.
