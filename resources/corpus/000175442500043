Genomewide analysis of mRNA processing in yeast using splicing-specific microarrays
Introns interrupt almost every eukaryotic protein-coding gene, yet how the splicing apparatus interprets the genome during messenger RNA (mRNA) synthesis is poorly understood. We designed microarrays to distinguish spliced from unspliced RNA for each intron-containing yeast gene and measured genomewide effects on splicing caused by loss of 18 different mRNA processing factors. After accommodating changes in transcription and decay by using gene-specific indexes, functional relationships between mRNA processing factors can be identified through their common effects on spliced and unspliced RNA. Groups of genes with different dependencies on mRNA processing factors are also apparent. Quantitative polymerase chain reactions confirm the array-based finding that Prp17p and Prp18p are not dispensable for removal of introns with short branchpoint-to-3' splice site distances.
