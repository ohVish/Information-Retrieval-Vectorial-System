Measuring Chromatin Interaction Dynamics on the Second Time Scale at Single-Copy Genes
The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay is widely used to capture interactions between chromatin and regulatory proteins, but it is unknown how stable most native interactions are. Although live-cell imaging suggests short-lived interactions at tandem gene arrays, current methods cannot measure rapid binding dynamics at single-copy genes. We show, by using a modified ChIP assay with subsecond temporal resolution, that the time dependence of formaldehyde cross-linking can be used to extract in vivo on and off rates for site-specific chromatin interactions varying over a similar to 100-fold dynamic range. By using the method, we show that a regulatory process can shift weakly bound TATA-binding protein to stable promoter interactions, thereby facilitating transcription complex formation. This assay provides an approach for systematic, quantitative analyses of chromatin binding dynamics in vivo.
