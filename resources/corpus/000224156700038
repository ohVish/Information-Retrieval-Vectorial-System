High-quality electron beams from a laser wakefield accelerator using plasma-channel guiding
Laser-driven accelerators, in which particles are accelerated by the electric field of a plasma wave ( the wakefield) driven by an intense laser, have demonstrated accelerating electric fields of hundreds of GV m(-1) ( refs 1 - 3). These fields are thousands of times greater than those achievable in conventional radiofrequency accelerators, spurring interest in laser accelerators(4,5) as compact next-generation sources of energetic electrons and radiation. To date, however, acceleration distances have been severely limited by the lack of a controllable method for extending the propagation distance of the focused laser pulse. The ensuing short acceleration distance results in low-energy beams with 100 per cent electron energy spread(1-3), which limits potential applications. Here we demonstrate a laser accelerator that produces electron beams with an energy spread of a few per cent, low emittance and increased energy ( more than 10(9) electrons above 80 MeV). Our technique involves the use of a preformed plasma density channel to guide a relativistically intense laser, resulting in a longer propagation distance. The results open the way for compact and tunable high-brightness sources of electrons and radiation.
