SOL-1 is a CUB-domain protein required for GLR-1 glutamate receptor function in C-elegans
Ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) mediate most excitatory synaptic signalling between neurons. Binding of the neurotransmitter glutamate causes a conformational change in these receptors that gates open a transmembrane pore through which ions can pass. The gating of iGluRs is crucially dependent on a conserved amino acid that was first identified in the 'lurcher' ataxic mouse(1). Through a screen for modifiers of iGluR function in a transgenic strain of Caenorhabditis elegans expressing a GLR-1 subunit containing the lurcher mutation, we identify suppressor of lurcher (sol-1). This gene encodes a transmembrane protein that is predicted to contain four extracellular beta-barrel-forming domains known as CUB domains(2,3). SOL-1 and GLR-1 are colocalized at the cell surface and can be coimmunoprecipitated. By recording from neurons expressing GLR-1, we show that SOL-1 is an accessory protein that is selectively required for glutamate-gated currents. We propose that SOL-1 participates in the gating of non-NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) iGluRs, thereby providing a previously unknown mechanism of regulation for this important class of neurotransmitter receptor.
