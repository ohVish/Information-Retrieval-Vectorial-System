Interception of comet Hyakutake's ion tail at a distance of 500 million kilometres
Remote sensing observations(1-5) and the direct sampling of material(6-8) from a few comets have established the characteristic composition of cometary gas. This gas is ionized by solar ultraviolet radiation and the solar wind to form 'pick-up' ions(9-11), ions in a low ionization state that retain the same compositional signatures as the original gas. The pick-up ions are carried outward by the solar wind, and they could in principle be detected far from the coma. (Sampling of pick-up ions has also been used to study interplanetary dust(12,13), Venus' tail(14) and the interstellar medium(15,16).) Here we report the serendipitous detection of cometary pick-up ions, most probably associated with the tail of comet Hyakutake, at a distance of 3.4 AU from the nucleus. Previous observations have provided a wealth of physical and chemical information about a small sample of comets(6-9), but this detection suggests that remote sampling of comet compositions, and the discovery of otherwise invisible comets, may be possible.
