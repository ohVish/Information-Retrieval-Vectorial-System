Controlled atomic doping of a single C-60 molecule
We report a method for controllably attaching an arbitrary number of charge dopant atoms directly to a single, isolated molecule. Charge-donating K atoms adsorbed on a silver surface were reversibly attached to a C-60 molecule by moving it over K atoms with a scanning tunneling microscope tip. Spectroscopic measurements reveal that each attached K atom donates a constant amount of charge ( similar to 0.6 electron charge) to the C-60 host, thereby enabling its molecular electronic structure to be precisely and reversibly tuned.
