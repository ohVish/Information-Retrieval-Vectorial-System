Rotationally resolved infrared spectrum of the charge transfer complex [Ar-N-2](+)
Difficulties in preparing cluster ions for spectroscopic studies have limited our understanding of intermolecular forces in charged complexes that are typical of many reactive intermediates. Here, the infrared spectrum of the charge transfer complex [Ar-N-2](+), recorded in a supersonic planar plasma with a tunable diode laser spectrometer, is presented. More than 70 adjacent rovibrational transitions were measured near 2272 wave numbers and assigned to the molecular nitrogen stretching fundamental in the (2)Sigma(+) ground state of [Ar-N-2](+). The accurate structural parameters that were determined confirm a linear structure and show that the major part of the charge is located at the argon atom. The latter result is surprising and implies a charge switch of the cationic center upon complexation.
