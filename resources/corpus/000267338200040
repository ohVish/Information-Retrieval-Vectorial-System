MicroRNA-92a Controls Angiogenesis and Functional Recovery of Ischemic Tissues in Mice
MicroRNAs (miRs) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression by binding to target messenger RNAs (mRNAs), leading to translational repression or degradation. Here, we show that the miR-17 similar to 92 cluster is highly expressed in human endothelial cells and that miR-92a, a component of this cluster, controls the growth of new blood vessels (angiogenesis). Forced overexpression of miR-92a in endothelial cells blocked angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. In mouse models of limb ischemia and myocardial infarction, systemic administration of an antagomir designed to inhibit miR-92a led to enhanced blood vessel growth and functional recovery of damaged tissue. MiR-92a appears to target mRNAs corresponding to several proangiogenic proteins, including the integrin subunit alpha5. Thus, miR-92a may serve as a valuable therapeutic target in the setting of ischemic disease.
