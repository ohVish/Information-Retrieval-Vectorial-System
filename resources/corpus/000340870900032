Observation of the transition state for pressure-induced BO3 -> BO4 conversion in glass
A fundamental mechanistic understanding of the pressure- and/or temperature-induced facile transformation of the coordination environment of boron is important for changing the physical properties of glass. We have used in situ high-pressure (up to 2 gigapascals) boron-11 solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in combination with ab initio calculations to investigate the nature of the transition state for the pressure-induced BO3 -> BO4 conversion in a borosilicate glass at ambient temperature. The results indicate an anisotropic elastic deformation of the BO3 planar triangle, under isotropic stress, into a trigonal pyramid that likely serves as a precursor for the subsequent formation of a BO4 tetrahedron.
