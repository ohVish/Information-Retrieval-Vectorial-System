Mid-Pleistocene Acheulean-like stone technology of the Bose basin, South China
Stone artifacts from the Bose basin, South China, are associated with tektites dated to 803,000 +/- 3000 years ago and represent the oldest known Large cutting tools (LCTs) in East Asia. Bose toolmaking is compatible with Mode 2 (Acheulean) technologies in Africa in its targeted manufacture and biased spatial distribution of LCTs, Large-scale flaking, and high flake scar counts. Acheulean-Like tools in the mid-Pleistocene of South China imply that Mode 2 technical advances were manifested in East Asia contemporaneously with handaxe technology in Africa and western Eurasia. Bose Lithic technology is associated with a tektite airfall and forest burning.
