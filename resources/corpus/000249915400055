In situ imaging of the endogenous CD8 T cell response to infection
Mounting a protective immune response is critically dependent on the orchestrated movement of cells within lymphoid organs. We report here the visualization, using major histocompatability complex class I tetramers, of the CD8-positive (CD8) T cell response in the spleens of mice to Listeria monocytogenes infection. A multistage pathway was revealed that included initial activation at the borders of the B and T cell zones followed by cluster formation with antigen-presenting cells leading to CD8 T cell exit to the red pulp via bridging channels. Strikingly, many memory CD8 T cells localized to the B cell zones and, when challenged, underwent rapid migration to the T cell zones where proliferation occurred, followed by egress via bridging channels in parallel with the primary response. Thus, the ability to track endogenous immune responses has uncovered both distinct and overlapping mechanisms and anatomical locations driving primary and secondary immune responses.
