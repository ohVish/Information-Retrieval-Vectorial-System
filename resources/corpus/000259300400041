Molecular coupling of Xist regulation and pluripotency
During mouse embryogenesis, reversion of imprinted X chromosome inactivation in the pluripotent inner cell mass of the female blastocyst is initiated by the repression of Xist from the paternal X chromosome. Here we report that key factors supporting pluripotency-Nanog, Oct3/4, and Sox2-bind within Xist intron 1 in undifferentiated embryonic stem ( ES) cells. Whereas Nanog null ES cells display a reversible and moderate up- regulation of Xist in the absence of any apparent modification of Oct3/4 and Sox2 binding, the drastic release of all three factors from Xist intron 1 triggers rapid ectopic accumulation of Xist RNA. We conclude that the three main genetic factors underlying pluripotency cooperate to repress Xist and thus couple X inactivation reprogramming to the control of pluripotency during embryogenesis.
