Dodeca-CLE peptides as suppressors of plant stem cell differentiation
In plants and animals, small peptide ligands that signal in cell-cell communication have been suggested to be a crucial component of development. A bioassay of single-cell transdifferentation demonstrates that a dodecapeptide with two hydroxyproline residues is the functional product of genes from the CLE family, which includes CLAVATA3 in Arabidopsis. The dodecapeptide suppresses xylem cell development at a concentration of 10(-11) M and promotes cell division. An application, corresponding to all 26 Arabidopsis CLE protein family members, of synthetic dodecapeptides reveals two counteracting signaling pathways involved in stem cell fate.
