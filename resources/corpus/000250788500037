Observation of the one-dimensional diffusion of nanometer-sized dislocation loops
Dislocations are ubiquitous linear defects and are responsible for many of the properties of crystalline materials. Studies on the glide process of dislocations in bulk materials have mostly focused on the response of dislocations with macroscopic lengths to external loading or unloading. Using in situ transmission electron microscopy, we show that nanometer-sized loops with a Burgers vector of 1/2 < 111 > in alpha-Fe can undergo one-dimensional diffusion even in the absence of stresses that are effective in driving the loops. The loop size dependence of the loop diffusivity obtained is explained by the stochastic thermal fluctuation in the numbers of double kinks.
