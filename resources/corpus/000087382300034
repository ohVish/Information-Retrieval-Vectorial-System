Photon-mediated hybridization of Frenkel excitons in organic semiconductor microcavities
Coherent excitations of intricate assemblies of molecules play an important role in natural photosynthesis. Microcavities are wavelength-dimension artificial structures in which excitations can be made to couple through their mutual interactions with confined photon modes, Results for microcavities containing two spatially separated cyanine dyes are presented here, where simultaneous strong coupling of the excitations of the individual dyes to a single cavity mode Leads to new eigenmodes, described as admixtures of ail three states. These "hybrid" exciton-photon structures are of potential interest as model systems in which to study energy capture, storage, and transfer among coherently coupled molecular excitations.
