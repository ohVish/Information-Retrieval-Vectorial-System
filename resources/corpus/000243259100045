Left-right dynein motor implicated in selective chromatid segregation in mouse cells
During cell division, copies of mouse chromosome 7 are segregated selectively or randomly to daughter cells depending on the cell type. The mechanism for differential segregation is unknown. Because mouse left-right dynein (LRD) gene mutations result in randomization of visceral organs' laterality, we hypothesized that LRD may also function in selective chromatid segregation. Indeed, upon knock-down by RNA interference methods, LRD depletion disrupts biased segregation. LRD messenger RNA presence or absence correlates with the observed segregation patterns. This work supports the claim that LRD functions in a mechanism for selective chromatid segregation.
