Multiple catenanes derived from calix[4] arenes
A multicatenane is described in which two belts consisting of four annelated rings attached to the wide rims of two calix[4]arenes are interwoven in such a way that each ring of one belt penetrates two adjacent rings of the other belt and vice versa. The key step of the synthesis of this [8]catenane is the exclusive formation of preorganized heterodimers between a multimacrocyclic tetraurea calix[ 4] arene and an "open-chain" tetraurea calix[4] arene containing eight omega-alkenyl groups. When a tetraurea calix[4] arene containing four alkenyl groups is used, a bis-[3]catenane is formed analogously.
