Crystal structures of human MD-2 and its complex with antiendotoxic lipid IVa
Endotoxic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with potent immunostimulatory activity is recognized by the receptor complex of MD-2 and Toll-like receptor 4. Crystal structures of human MD-2 and its complex with the antiendotoxic tetra-acylated lipid A core of LPS have been determined at 2.0 and 2.2 angstrom resolutions, respectively. MD-2 shows a deep hydrophobic cavity sandwiched by two beta sheets, in which four acyl chains of the ligand are fully confined. The phosphorylated glucosamine moieties are located at the entrance to the cavity. These structures suggest that MD-2 plays a principal role in endotoxin recognition and provide a basis for antiseptic drug development.
