High-energy colliders and the rise of the standard model
Over the past quarter of a century, experiments at high-energy particle colliders have established the standard model as the precise theory of particle interactions up to the 100 GeV scale. A series of important experimental discoveries and measurements have filled in most of the missing pieces and tested the predictions of the standard model with great precision.
