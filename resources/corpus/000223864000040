Post-mating clutch piracy in an amphibian
Female multiple mating and alternative mating systems can decrease the opportunity for sexual selection(1-3). Sperm competition is often the outcome of females mating with multiple males and has been observed in many animals(1,4-7), and alternative reproductive systems are widespread among species with external fertilization and parental care(3,8-10). Multiple paternity without associated complex behaviour related to mating or parental care is also seen in simultaneously spawning amphibians(11-15) and fishes(16) that release gametes into water. Here we report 'clutch piracy' in a montane population of the common frog Rana temporaria, a reproductive behaviour previously unknown in vertebrates with external fertilization. Males of this species clasp the females and the pair deposits one spherical clutch of eggs. No parental care is provided. 'Pirate' males search for freshly laid clutches, clasp them as they would do a female and fertilize the eggs that were left unfertilized by the 'parental' male. This behaviour does not seem to be size-dependent, and some males mate with a female and perform clutch piracy in the same season. Piracy affected 84% of the clutches and in some cases increased the proportion of eggs fertilized, providing direct fitness benefits both for the pirate males and the females(17). Sexual selection probably caused by a strong male-biased sex ratio-occurs in this population, as indicated by size-assortative mating; however, clutch piracy may reduce its impact. This provides a good model to explore how alternative mating strategies can affect the intensity of sexual selection.
