A light-emitting field-effect transistor (Retracted Article. See vol 298, pg 961, 2002)
We report here on the structure and operating characteristics of an ambipolar Light-emitting field-effect transistor based on single crystals of the organic semiconductor alpha -sexithiophene, Electrons and holes are injected from the source and drain electrodes, respectively. Their concentrations are controlled by the applied gate and drain-source voltages. Excitons are generated, Leading to radiative recombination. Moreover, above a remarkably Low threshold current, coherent light is emitted through amplified spontaneous emission. Hence, this three-terminal device is the basis of a very promising architecture for electrically driven laser action in organic semiconductors.
