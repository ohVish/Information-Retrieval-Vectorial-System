The human transcriptome map: Clustering of highly expressed genes in chromosomal domains
The chromosomal position of human genes is rapidly being established. We integrated these mapping data with genome-wide messenger RNA expression profiles as provided by SAGE (serial analysis of gene expression). Over 2.45 million SAGE transcript tags, including 160,000 tags of neuroblastomas, are presently known for 12 tissue types. We developed algorithms to assign these tags to UniGene clusters and their chromosomal position. The resulting Human Transcriptome Map generates gene expression profiles for ant chromosomal region in 12 normal and pathologic tissue types. The map reveals a clustering of highly expressed genes to specific chromosomal regions. It provides a tool to search for genes that are overexpressed or silenced in cancer.
