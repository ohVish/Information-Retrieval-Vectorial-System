Near-threshold inelastic collisions using molecular beams with a tunable velocity
Molecular scattering behavior has generally proven difficult to study at low collision energies. We formed a molecular beam of OH radicals with a narrow velocity distribution and a tunable absolute velocity by passing the beam through a Stark decelerator. The transition probabilities for inelastic scattering of the OH radicals with Xe atoms were measured as a function of the collision energy in the range of 50 to 400 wavenumbers, with an overall energy resolution of about 13 wavenumbers. The behavior of the cross-sections for inelastic scattering near the energetic thresholds was accurately measured, and excellent agreement was obtained with cross-sections derived from coupled-channel calculations on ab initio computed potential energy surfaces.
