Synthesis, assembly and applications of semiconductor nanomembranes
Research in electronic nanomaterials, historically dominated by studies of nanocrystals/fullerenes and nanowires/nanotubes, now incorporates a growing focus on sheets with nanoscale thicknesses, referred to as nanomembranes. Such materials have practical appeal because their two-dimensional geometries facilitate integration into devices, with realistic pathways to manufacturing. Recent advances in synthesis provide access to nanomembranes with extraordinary properties in a variety of configurations, some of which exploit quantum and other size-dependent effects. This progress, together with emerging methods for deterministic assembly, leads to compelling opportunities for research, from basic studies of two-dimensional physics to the development of applications of heterogeneous electronics.
