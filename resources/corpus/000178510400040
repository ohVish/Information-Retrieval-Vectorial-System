Nanometer resolution and coherent optical dipole coupling of two individual molecules
By performing cryogenic laser spectroscopy under scanning probe electrode that induces local electric field, we have resolved two individual fluorescent molecules separated by 12 nanometers in an organic crystal. The two molecules undergo strong coherent dipole-dipole coupling that produces entangled sub- and superradiant states. Under intense laser illumination, both molecules are excited via two-photon transition, and the fluorescence from this doubly excited system displays photon bunching. Our experimental scheme can be used to optically resolve molecules at the nanometer scale and to manipulate the degree of entanglement among them.
