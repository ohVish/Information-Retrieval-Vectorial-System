Lymphangiogenesis in development and human disease
The lymphatic vasculature forms a vessel network that drains interstitial fluid from tissues and returns it to the blood. Lymphatic vessels are also an essential part of the body's immune defence. They have an important role in the pathogenesis of several diseases, such as cancer, lymphoedema and various inflammatory conditions. Recent biological and technological developments in lymphatic vascular biology will lead to a better understanding and treatment of these diseases.
