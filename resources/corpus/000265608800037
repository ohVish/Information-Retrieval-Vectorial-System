Evolution of the Rembrandt Impact Basin on Mercury
MESSENGER's second Mercury flyby revealed a similar to 715-kilometer-diameter impact basin, the second-largest well-preserved basin-scale impact structure known on the planet. The Rembrandt basin is comparable in age to the Caloris basin, is partially flooded by volcanic plains, and displays a unique wheel-and-spoke-like pattern of basin-radial and basin-concentric wrinkle ridges and graben. Stratigraphic relations indicate a multistaged infilling and deformational history involving successive or overlapping phases of contractional and extensional deformation. The youngest deformation of the basin involved the formation of a similar to 1000-kilometer-long lobate scarp, a product of the global cooling and contraction of Mercury.
