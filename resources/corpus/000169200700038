Laser technology - Free-electron lasers: Status and applications
A free-electron laser consists of an electron beam propagating through a periodic magnetic field. Today such Lasers are used for research in materials science, chemical : technology, biophysical science, medical applications, surface studies, and solid-state physics. Free-electron Lasers with higher average power and shorter wavelengths are under development. Future applications range from industrial processing of materials to light sources for soft and hard x-rays.
