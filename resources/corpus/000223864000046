Pilus chaperones represent a new type of protein-folding catalyst
Adhesive type 1 pili from uropathogenic Escherichia coli strains have a crucial role during infection by mediating the attachment to and potentially the invasion of host tissue. These filamentous, highly oligomeric protein complexes are assembled by the 'chaperone-usher' pathway(1), in which the individual pilus subunits fold in the bacterial periplasm and form stoichiometric complexes with a periplasmic chaperone molecule that is essential for pilus assembly(2-4). The chaperone subsequently delivers the subunits to an assembly platform (usher) in the outer membrane, which mediates subunit assembly and translocation to the cell surface(5-8). Here we show that the periplasmic type 1 pilus chaperone FimC binds non-native pilus subunits and accelerates folding of the subunit FimG by 100-fold. Moreover, we find that the FimC FimG complex is formed quantitatively and very rapidly when folding of FimG is initiated in the presence of both FimC and the assembly-competent subunit FimF, even though the FimC-FimG complex is thermodynamically less stable than the FimF-FimG complex. FimC thus represents a previously unknown type of protein-folding catalyst, and simultaneously acts as a kinetic trap preventing spontaneous subunit assembly in the periplasm.
