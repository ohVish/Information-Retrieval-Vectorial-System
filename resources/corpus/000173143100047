Extension of life-span in Caenorhabditis elegans by a diet lacking coenzyme Q
The isoprenylated benzoquinone coenzyme Q is a redox-active lipid essential for electron transport in aerobic respiration. Here, we show that withdrawal of coenzyme Q (Q) from the diet of wild-type nematodes extends adult life-span by similar to 60%. The longevity of clk-1, daf-2, daf-12, and daf-16 mutants is also extended by a Q-less diet. These results establish the importance of Q in life-span determination. The findings suggest that Q and the daf-2 pathway intersect at the mitochondria and imply that a concerted production coupled with enhanced scavenging of reactive oxygen species contributes to the substantial life-span extension.
