Nodulation of legumes by members of the beta-subclass of Proteobacteria
Members of the Leguminosae form the largest plant family on Earth, with around 18,000 species. The success of legumes can largely be attributed to their ability to form a nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with specific bacteria known as rhizobia, manifested by the development of nodules on the plant roots in which the bacteria rx atmospheric nitrogen, a major contributor to the global nitrogen cycle. Rhizobia described so far belong exclusively to the a-subclass of Proteobacteria, where they are distributed in four distinct phylogenetic branches(1,2). Although nitrogen-fixing bacteria exist in other proteobacterial subclasses, for example Herbaspirillum and Azoarcus from the phylogenetically distant beta -subclass, none has been found to harbour the nod genes essential for establishing rhizobial symbiosis(3,4). Here we report the identification of proteobacteria from the b-subclass that nodulate legumes. This finding shows that the ability to establish a symbiosis with legumes is more widespread in bacteria than anticipated to date.
