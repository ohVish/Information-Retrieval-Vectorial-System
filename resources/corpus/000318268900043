Complex N-Heterocycle Synthesis via Iron-Catalyzed, Direct C-H Bond Amination
The manipulation of traditionally unreactive functional groups is of paramount importance in modern chemical synthesis. We have developed an iron-dipyrrinato catalyst that leverages the reactivity of iron-borne metal-ligand multiple bonds to promote the direct amination of aliphatic C-H bonds. Exposure of organic azides to the iron dipyrrinato catalyst furnishes saturated, cyclic amine products (N-heterocycles) bearing complex core-substitution patterns. This study highlights the development of C-H bond functionalization chemistry for the formation of saturated, cyclic amine products and should find broad application in the context of both pharmaceuticals and natural product synthesis.
