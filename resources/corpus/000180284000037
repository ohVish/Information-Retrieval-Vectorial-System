Diminished pupillary light reflex at high irradiances in melanopsin-knockout mice
In the mammalian retina, a small subset of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are intrinsically photosensitive, express the opsin-like protein melanopsin, and project to brain nuclei involved in non image-forming visual functions such as pupillary light re ex and circadian photoentrainment. We report that in mice with the melanopsin gene ablated, RGCs retrograde-labeled from the suprachiasmatic nuclei were no longer intrinsically photosensitive, although their number, morphology, and projections were unchanged. These animals showed a pupillary light re ex indistinguishable from that of the wild type at low irradiances, but at high irradiances the re ex was incomplete, a pattern that suggests that the melanopsin-associated system and the classical rod/cone system are complementary in function.
